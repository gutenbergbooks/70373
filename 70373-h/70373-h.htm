<p>If the writer could materialize in the reader’s mind that large
aggregate of printed matter now stacked on book-shelves and filed
in newspaper columns, which has been published to the world
during the last eighty years upon Alaska, the effect would certainly
be startling.</p>

<p>Scores of weighty volumes, hundreds of pamphlets and magazine
articles, and a thousand newspaper letters, have been devoted
to the subject of Alaskan life, scenery, and value. In contemplation
of this, viewed from the author’s standpoint of extended personal
experience, he announces his determination to divest himself
of all individuality in the following chapters, to portray in
word, and by brush and pencil, the life and country of Alaska as it
is, so clearly and so truthfully, that the reader may draw his or her
own inference, just as though he or she stood upon the ground
itself.</p>

<p>How differently a number of us are impressed in the viewing of
any one subject, by which observation we utterly fail to agree as to
its character and worth! This variance is handsomely illustrated
by the diverse opinion of Alaskan travellers.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The stolid, calm intrepidity of the Russian is not even yet well
understood or recognized by Americans. No better presentation
of this character of those Slavic discoverers of Alaska can be made
than is the one descriptive of Veit Bering’s voyage of Russian-American
fame, in which shipwreck and death robbed him of the
glory of his expedition. No legend of the sea, however fanciful or
horrid, surpasses the simple truth of the terror and privation which
went hand-in-hand with Bering and his crew.</p>

<p>Flushed with the outspoken favor of his sovereign, Bering and
his lieutenant, Tschericov, sailed east from Petropaulovsky, Kamchatka,
June 4, 1741; the expedition consisted of two small sail-vessels,
the <em>St. Peter</em> and the <em>St. Paul</em>. They set their course
S. S. E., as low as the 50th degree of north latitude, then they
decided to steer directly east for the reported American continent.
A few days later a violent storm arose, it separated the rude ships,
and the two commanders never met in life again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>While groping in fog and tempest on the high seas, Bering
drifted one Sunday (July 18th) upon or about the Alaskan mainland
coast; he disembarked at the foot of some low, desolate bluffs that
face the sea near the spot now known to us as Kayak Island, and in
plain view of those towering peaks of the St. Elias Alps. He passed
full six weeks in this neighborhood, while the crew were busy
getting fresh food-supplies, water, etc., when, on the 3d of September,
a storm of unwonted vigor burst upon them, lasted seven days,
and drove them out to sea and before it, down as far as 48° 8´
north latitude, and into the lonely wastes of the vast Pacific.
Scurvy began to appear on board the <em>St. Peter</em>; hardly a day
passed without recording the death of some one of the ship’s company,
and soon men enough in health or strength sufficient to work
the vessel could not be mustered. A return to Kamchatka was
resolved upon.</p>

<p>Bering became surly and morose, and seldom appeared on
deck, and so the second in command, “Stoorman” Vachtel, directed
the dreary cruise. After regaining the land, and burying a sailor
named Shoomagin on one of a group of Alaskan islets that bear his
name to-day, and making several additional capes and landfalls,
they saw two islands which, by a most unfortunate blunder, they
took to be of the Kurile chain, and adjacent to Kamchatka. Thus
they erred sadly in their reckoning, and sailed out upon a false
point of departure.</p>

<p>In vain they craned their necks for the land, and strained their
feeble eyes; the shore of Kamchatka refused to rise, and it finally
dawned upon them that they were lost—that there was no hope of
making a port in that goal so late in the year. The wonderful
discipline of the Russian sailors was strikingly exhibited at this
stage of the luckless voyage: in spite of their debilitated and
emaciated condition, they still obeyed orders, though suffering
frightfully in the cold and wet; the ravages of scurvy had made
such progress that the steersman was conducted to the helm by
two other invalids who happened to have the use of their legs, and
who supported him under the arms! When he could no longer
steer from suffering, then he was succeeded by another no better
able to execute the labor than himself. Thus did the unhappy
crew waste away into death and impotency. They were obliged to
carry few sails, for they were helpless to reef or hoist them, and
such as they had were nearly worn out; and even in this case they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
were unable to renew them by replacing from the stores, since
there were no seamen strong enough on the ship to bend new ones
to the yards and booms.</p>

<p>Soon rain was followed by snow, the nights grew longer and
darker, and they now lived in dreadful anticipation of shipwreck;
the fresh water diminished, and the labor of working the vessel
became too severe for the few who were able to be about. From
the 1st to the 4th of November the ship had lain as a log on the
ocean, helpless and drifting, at the sport of the wind and the waves.
Then again, in desperation, they managed to control her, and set
her course anew to the westward, without knowing absolutely anything
as to where they were. In a few hours after, the joy of the
distressed crew can be better imagined than described, for, looming
up on the gray, gloomy horizon, they saw the snow-covered tops
of high hills, still distant however, ahead. As they drew nearer,
night came upon them, and they judged best, therefore, to keep
out at sea “off and on” until daybreak, so as to avoid the risk of
wrecking themselves in the deep darkness. When the gray light of
early morning dawned, they found that the rigging on the starboard
side of the vessel was giving way, and that their craft could
not be much longer managed; that the fresh water was very low,
and that sickness was increasing frightfully. The raw humidity of
the climate was now succeeded by dry, intense cold; life was well-nigh
insupportable on shipboard then, so, after a brief consultation,
they determined to make for the land, save their lives, and, if
possible, safely beach the <em>St. Peter</em>.</p>

<p>The small sails were alone set; the wind was north; thirty-six
fathoms of water over a sand bottom; two hours after they decreased
it to twelve; they now contrived to get over an anchor and
run it out at three-quarters of a cable’s length; at six in the evening
this hawser parted; tremendous waves bore the helpless boat
on in toward the land through the darkness and the storm, where
soon she struck twice upon a rocky reef. Yet, in a moment after,
they had five fathoms of water; a second anchor was thrown out,
and again the tackle parted; and while, in the energy of wild despair,
prostrated by sheets of salty spray that swept over them in
bursts of fury, they were preparing a third bower, a huge combing
wave lifted that ark of misery—that band of superlative human
suffering—safely and sheer over the reef, where in an instant the
tempest-tossed ship rested in calm water; the last anchor was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
dropped, and thus this luckless voyage of Alaskan discovery came
to an end.</p>

<p>Bering died here, on one of the Commander Islands,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> where he
had been wrecked as above related; the survivors, forty-five souls
in number, lived through the winter on the flesh of sea-lions, the
sea-cow,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> or manatee, and thus saved their scanty stock of flour;
they managed to build a little shallop out of the remains of the
<em>St. Peter</em>, in which they left Bering Island—departed from this
scene of a most extraordinary shipwreck and deliverance—on
August 16, 1742, and soon reached Petropaulovsky in safety the
27th following. In addition to an authentic knowledge of the
location of a great land to the eastward, the survivors carried from
their camp at Bering Island a large number of valuable sea-otter,
blue-fox, and other peltries, which stimulated, as no other inducement
could have done, the prompt fitting out and venture of many
new expeditions for the freshly discovered land and islands of
Alaska.</p>

</figure>

<p>So, in 1745, Michael Novodiskov first, of all white men, pushed
over in a rude open wooden shallop from Kamchatka, and landed
on Attoo, that extreme western islet of the great Aleutain chain
which forms upon the map a remarkable southern wall to the
green waters of Bering Sea. No object of geographical search was
in this hardy fur-hunter’s mind as he perilled his life in that
adventure—far from it; he was after the precious pelage of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>sea-otter, and like unto him were all of the long list of Russian explorers
of Alaskan coasts and waters. These rough, indomitable
men ventured out from their headquarters at Kamchatka and the
Okotsk Sea in rapid succession as years rolled on, until by the end
of 1768-69 a large area of Russian America was well determined
and rudely charted by them.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The history of this early exploration of Russian America is the
stereotyped story of wrongs inflicted upon simple natives by ruthless,
fearless adventurers—year in and year out—the eager, persistent
examination of the then unknown shores and interior of Alaska
by tireless Cossacks and Muscovites, who were busy in robbing the
aborigines and quarrelling among themselves. The success of the
earliest fur-hunters had been so great, and heralded so loudly in
the Russian possessions, that soon every Siberian merchant who
had a few thousand rubles at his order managed to associate himself
with some others, so that they might together fit out a slovenly
craft or two and engage in the same remunerative business. The
records show that, prior to the autocratic control of the old Russian
American Company over all Alaska in 1799, more than sixty distinct
Russian trading companies were organized and plying their
vocation in these waters and landings of Alaska.</p>

<p>They all carried on their operations in essentially the same manner:
the owner or owners of the shallop, or sloop, or schooner, as
it might be, engaged a crew on shares; the cargo of furs brought
back by this vessel was invariably divided into two equal subdivisions—one
of these always claimed by the owners who had furnished
the means, and the other half divided in such a manner as
the navigator, the trader, and the crew could agree upon between
themselves. Then, after this division had been made, each participant
was to give one-tenth part of his portion, as received above, to
the Government at St. Petersburg, which, stimulated by such generous
swelling of its treasury, never failed to keep an affectionate
eye upon its subjects over here, and encouraged them to the utmost
limit of exertion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>This Imperial impetus undoubtedly was the spur which caused
most of that cruel domination of the Russians over a simple people
whom they found at first in possession of their new fur-bearing
land; the thrifty traders managed to do their business with an exceedingly
small stock of goods, and, where no opposition was offered,
these unscrupulous commercial travellers ordered the natives out
to hunt and turn over all their booty, not even condescending to
pay them, except a few beads or strips of tobacco, “in return for
their good behavior and submission to the crown!” Naturally
enough, the treacherous Koloshes of Sitka, the dogged Kadiakers,
the vivacious Eskimo or Innuits, and even the docile Aleutes,
would every now and then arise and slaughter in their rage and
despair a whole trading post or ship’s crew of Russians; but these
outbreaks were not of preconcerted plan or strength, and never
seriously interrupted the iron rule of Slavonian oppression.</p>

<p>The rapidly increasing number of competitors in the fur trade,
however, soon began to create a scarcity of the raw material, and
then the jealousies and rivalries of the trading companies began in
turn to vent themselves in armed struggles against each other for
possession and gain. This order of affairs quickly threw the whole
region into a reign of anarchy which threatened to destroy the very
existence of the Russians themselves. Facing this deplorable condition,
one of the leading promoters of the fur-trading industry in
Alaska saw that, unless a bold man was placed at the head of the
conduct of his business, it would soon be ruined. This man he
picked out at Kargopol, Siberia, and on August 18, 1790, he concluded
a contract with Alexander Baranov, who sailed that day
from the Okotsk, and who finally established that enduring basis
of trade and Russian domination in Alaska which held till our purchase
in 1867 of all its vested rights and title.</p>

<p>The wild savage life which the Russians led in these early days
of their possession of this new land—their bitter personal antagonisms
and their brutal orgies—actually beggar description, and
seem well-nigh incredible to the trader or traveller who sojourns in
Alaska to-day. It is commonly regarded as a rude order of existence
up there among ourselves now; and when we come to think
back, and contrast the stormy past with the calm present, it is difficult
to comprehend it; yet it is not so strange if it be remembered
that they were practically beyond all reach of authority, and
lived for many consecutive years in absolute non-restraint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>It is easy to trace the several steps and understand the motives
which led to our purchase of Alaska. There was no subtle statecraft
involved, and no significance implied. The Russian Government
simply grew weary of looking after the American territory,
which was an element of annually increasing cost to the Imperial
treasury, and was a source of anxiety and weakness in all European
difficulties. It became apparent to the minds of the governing council
at St. Petersburg that Russians could not, or at least, would not
settle in Russian America to build up a state or province, or do anything
else there which would redound to the national honor and
strength. This view they were well grounded in, after the ripe experience
of a century’s control and ownership.</p>

<p>One period in that history of Russian rule afforded to the authorities
much rosy anticipation. This interval was that season
in the affairs of the Russian American Company which was known
as Baranov’s administration, in which time the revenues to the
crown were rich, and annually increasing. But Baranov was a practical
business man, while every one of his successors, although distinguished
men in the naval and army circles of the home government,
was not. Comment is unnecessary. The change became
marked; the revenues rapidly declined, and the conduct of the
operations of the company soon became a matter of loss and not of
gain to the stockholders and to the Imperial treasury. The history,
however, of the rise and fall of this great Russian trading association
is a most interesting one; much more so even than that of its
ancient though still surviving, but decrepit rival, the Hudson’s Bay
Company.</p>

<p>Those murderous factional quarrels of the competing Russian
traders throughout Alaska in 1790-98 finally compelled the Emperor
Paul to grant, in 1799, much against his will, a charter to a
consolidation of the leading companies engaged in American fur-hunting,
which was named the Russian American Company. It
also embraced the Eastern Siberian and Kamchatkan colonies.
That charter gave to this company the exclusive right to all the territory
in Alaska, Kamchatka, and the Siberian Okotsk, and Kurile
districts, and the privileges conferred by this charter were very
great and of the most autocratic nature; but at the same time the
company was shrewdly burdened with deftly framed obligations,
being compelled to maintain, at its own expense, the new government
of the country, a church establishment, a military force, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
at various points in the territory, ample magazines of provisions and
stores to be used by the Imperial Government for its naval vessels
or land troops whenever ordered. At a time when all such stores
had to be transported on land trails over the desolate wastes of Siberia
from Russia to the Okotsk, this clause in the franchise was
most burdensome, and really fatal to the financial success of the
company.</p>

<p>The finesse of the Russian authorities is strikingly manifested in
that charter, which ostensibly granted to the Russian American Company
all these rights of exclusive jurisdiction to a vast domain without
selfishly exacting a single tax for the home treasury; but in
fact it did pay an immense sum annually into the royal coffers in
this way. The entire fur trade in those days was with China, and
all the furs of Alaska were bartered by the Russians with the Mongols
for teas, which were sold in Russia and Europe. The records
of the Imperial treasury show that the duties paid into it by this
company upon these teas often exceeded two millions of silver
rubles annually.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The company was also obliged, by the terms of their charter, to
make experiments in the establishment of agricultural settlements
wherever the soil and climate of Alaska would permit. The natives
of Alaska were freed from all taxes in skins or money, but were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
obliged to furnish to the company’s order certain quotas of sea-otter
hunters every season, all men between the ages of eighteen
and fifty being liable to this draft, though not more than one-half
of any number thus subject could be enlisted and called out at any
one time.</p>

<p>The management of this great organization was vested in an administrative
council, composed of its stockholders in St. Petersburg,
with a head general office at Irkutsk, Siberia—a chief manager, who
was to reside in Alaska, and was styled “The Governor,” and whose
selection was ordered from the officers of the Imperial navy not
lower in rank than post-captain. That high official and Alaskan
autocrat had an assistant, also a naval officer, and each received pay
from the Russian Company, in addition to their regular governmental
salaries, which were continued to them by the Crown.</p>

<p>In cases of mutiny or revolt the powers of the governor were absolute.
He had also the fullest jurisdiction at all times over offenders
and criminals, with the nominal exception of capital crimes.
Such culprits were supposed to have a preliminary trial, then were
to be forwarded to the nearest court of justice in Siberia. Something
usually “happened” to save them the tedious journey, however.
The Russian servants of the company—its numerous retinue
of post-traders, factors, and traders, and laborers of every class
around the posts—were engaged for a certain term of years, duly
indentured. When the time expired the company was bound to
furnish them free transportation back to their homes, unless the
unfortunate individuals were indebted to it; then they could be retained
by the employer until the debt was paid. It is needless to
state in this connection that an incredibly small number of Russians
were ever homeward bound from Alaska during these long years of
Muscovitic control and operation. This provision of debtor <em>vs.</em> creditor
was one which enabled the creditor company to retain in its
service any and all men among the humbler classes whose services
were desirable, because the scanty remuneration, the wretched pittance
in lieu of wages, allowed them, made it a matter of utter impossibility
to keep out of debt to the company’s store. Even among
the higher officials it is surprising to scan the long list of those who,
after serving one period of seven years after another, never seemed
to succeed in clearing themselves from the iron grasp of indebtedness
to the great corporation which employed them.</p>

<p>As long as the Russian Company maintained a military or naval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
force in the Alaskan territory, at its own expense, these forces were
entirely at the disposal of its governor, who passed most of his time
in elegant leisure at Sitka, where the finest which the markets and
the vineyards of the world afforded were regularly drawn upon to
supply his table. No set of men ever lived in more epicurean comfort
and abundance than did those courtly chief magistrates of
Alaska who succeeded the plain Baranov in 1818, and who established
and maintained the vice-regal comfort of their physical existence
uninterruptedly until it was surrendered, with the cession
of their calling, in 1867.</p>

<p>The charter of the Russian American Company was first granted
for a period of twenty years, dating at the outset from January 1,
1799. It also had the right to hoist its own colors, to employ naval
officers to command its vessels, and to subscribe itself, in its proclamation
or petition, “Under the highest protection of his Imperial
Majesty, the Russian American Company.” It began at once to
attract much attention in Russia, especially among moneyed men in
St. Petersburg and Moscow. Nobles and high officials of the Government
eagerly sought shares of its stock, and even the Emperor
and members of his family invested in them, the latter making their
advances in this direction under the pretext of donating their portions
to schools and to charitable institutions. It was the first enterprise
of the kind which had ever originated in the Russian Empire, and,
favored in this manner by the Crown, it rose rapidly into public
confidence. A future of the most glowing prosperity and stability
was prophesied for it by its supporters—a prosperity and power as
great as ever that of the British East India Company—while many
indulged dreams of Japanese annexation and portions of China, together
with the whole American coast, including California.</p>

<p>But that clause in the charter of the company, which ordered
that the chief manager of its affairs in Alaska should be selected
from the officers of the Imperial navy, had a most unfortunate effect
upon the successful conduct of the business, as it was prosecuted
throughout Russian America. After Baranov’s suspension
and departure, in the autumn of 1818, not a single practical merchant
or business man succeeded him. The rigid personal scrutiny
and keen trading instinct which were so characteristic of him, were
followed immediately by the very reverse; hence the dividends began
to diminish every year, while the official writing, on the other
hand, became suddenly more voluminous, graphic, and declared a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
steady increase of prosperity. Each succeeding chief manager, or
governor, vied with the reports of his predecessors in making a
record of great display in the line of continued explorations, erection
of buildings, construction of ships of all sizes, and the establishment
of divers new industries and manufactories, agriculture,
etc.</p>

<p>The second term of the Russian American Company’s charter
expired in 1841, and the directors and shareholders labored most
industriously for another renewal; the Crown took much time in
consideration, but in 1844 the new grant was confirmed, and
rather increased the rights and privileges of the company, if anything;
still matters did not mend financially, the affairs of the large
corporation were continued in the same reckless management by
one governor after the other—with the same extravagant vice-regal
display and costly living—with useless and abortive experiments in
agriculture, in mining and in ship-building, so that by the approach
of the lapsing of the third term of twenty years’ control, in 1864,
the company was deeply in debt, and though desirous of continuing
the business, it now endeavored to transfer the cost of maintaining
its authority in Alaska to the home Government; to this the Imperial
Cabinet was both unwilling and unable to accede, for Russia
had just emerged from a disastrous and expensive war, and was in
no state of mind to incur a single extra ruble of indebtedness
which she could avoid. In the meantime, pending these domestic
difficulties between the Crown and the company, the charter expired;
the Government refused to renew it, and sought, by sending
out commissioners to Sitka, for a solution of the vexed problem.</p>

<p>Now, if the reader will mark it, right at this time and at this
juncture, arose the opportunity which was quickly used by Seward,
as Secretary of State, to the ultimate and speedy acquisition of
Russian America by the American Union. Those difficulties which
the situation revealed in respect to the affairs of the Russian Company
conflicting with the desire of the Imperial Government, made
much stir in all interested financial circles. A small number of
San Francisco capitalists had been for many years passive stockholders
in what was termed by courtesy the American Russian Ice
Company—it being nothing more than a name really, inasmuch as
very little ever was or has been done in the way of shipping ice to
California from Alaska. Nevertheless these gentlemen quickly conceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the idea of taking the charter of the Russian Company themselves,
and offered a sum far in excess of what had accrued to the
Imperial treasury at any time during the last forty years’ tenure of
the old contract. The negotiations were briskly proceeding, and
were in a fair way to a successful ending, when it informally became
known to Secretary Seward, who at once had his interest excited
in the subject, and speedily arrived at the conclusion that if it
was worth paying $5,000,000 by a handful of American merchants
for a twenty years’ lease of Alaska, it was well worthy the cost of
buying it out and out in behalf of the United States; inasmuch as
leasing it, as the Russians intended to, was a virtual surrender of it
absolutely for the period named. In this spirit the politic Seward
approached the Russian Government, and the final consummation of
Alaska’s purchase was easily effected,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> May, 1867, and formally
transferred to our flag on the 18th of October following.</p>

<p>If the Russian Government had not been in an exceedingly
friendly state of mind with regard to the American Union, this somewhat
abrupt determination on its part to make such a virtual gift
of its vast Alaskan domain would never have been thought of in St.
Petersburg for a moment. Still, it should be well understood from
the Muscovitic view, that in presenting Russian America to us, no
loss to the glory or the power of the Czar’s Crown resulted; no surrender
of smiling hamlets, towns or cities, no mines or mining, no
fish or fishing, no mills, factories or commerce—nothing but her
good will and title to a few thousand poor and simple natives, and
a large wilderness of mountain, tundra-moor and island-archipelago
wholly untouched, unreclaimed by the hand of civilized man. Russia
then, as now, suffered and still suffers, from an embarrassment of
just such natural wealth as that which we so hopefully claim as
our own Alaska.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Bering’s Island—he was wrecked on the east coast, at a point under steep
bluffs now known as “Kommandor.” Scarcely a vestige of this shipwreck
now remains there.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> That curious creature is extinct. It formerly inhabited the sea-shores
of these two small islands. The German naturalist Steller, who was the surgeon
of Bering’s ship, has given us the only account we have of this animal’s
appearance and habits; it was the largest of all the Sirenians; attained a length
sometimes of thirty feet. When first discovered it was extremely abundant,
and formed the main source of food-supply for the shipwrecked crew of Bering’s
vessel. Twenty-seven years afterward it became extinct, due to the
merciless hunting and slaughter of it by the Russians, who, on their way over
to Alaska from Kamchatka, always made it an object to stop at Bering or Copper
Island and fill up large casks with the flesh of this sea-cow. Its large size,
inactive habits, and clumsy progress in the water, together with its utter fearlessness
of man, made its extinction rapid and feasible.</p>

<p>I make the restoration from a careful study of the details of Steller’s
description.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> The order of this search and voyaging has been faithfully recorded
by Ivan Petroff in his admirable compendium of the subject. (See Tenth
Census U. S. A., Vol. VIII.) While this narrative may be interesting to a
historian, yet I deem it best not to inflict it upon the general reader.
Also in “Bancroft’s History of Alaska,” recently published at San Francisco,
it is graphically and laboriously described.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> The Russian currency is always expressed in kopecks and in rubles.
Gold coinage there is seldom ever seen, and was never used in Alaska. The
following table explains itself:</p>

<p class="no-indent">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">1 copper kopeck&#160; = 1 silver kopeck.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">2 copper kopecks = 1 grösh.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">3 copper kopecks = 1 alteen.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">5 copper kopecks = 1 peetak.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">5 silver kopecks = 1 peetak.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">10 silver kopecks = 1 greevnah.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">15 silver kopecks = 1 peteealtin.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">20 silver kopecks = 1 dvoogreevenik.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">25 silver kopecks = 1 chetvertak.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">50 silver kopecks = 1 polteenah.</span><br>
100 silver kopecks = 1 ruble.<br>
</p>

<p>The silver ruble is nearly equal to seventy-five cents in our coin. The
paper ruble fluctuates in Russia from forty to fifty cents, specie value; in
Alaska it was rated at twenty cents, silver. Much of the “paper” currency
in Alaska during Russian rule was stamped on little squares of walrus hide.</p>

<p>A still smaller coin, called the “<em>polooshka</em>” worth ¼ kopeck, has been used
in Russia. It takes its name from a hare-skin, “<em>ooshka</em>,” or “little ears,”
which, before the use of money by the Slavs, was one of the lowest articles
of exchange, <em>pol</em> signifying <em>half</em>, and <em>polooshka</em>, <em>half a hare’s skin</em>. From another
small coin, the “<em>deinga</em>” (equal to ½ kopeck in value), is derived the
Russian word for money, <em>deingah</em> or <em>deingie</em>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> $7,200,000 gold was paid by the United States into the Imperial treasury
of Russia for the Territory of Alaska; it is said that most of this was used in
St. Petersburg to satisfy old debts and obligations incurred by Alaskan enterprises,
attorneys’ fees, etc. So, in short, Russia really gave her American possessions
to the American people, reaping no direct emolument or profit whatsoever
from the transfer.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The general contour of Alaska is correctly rendered on any and
all charts published to-day; but it is usually drawn to a very much
reduced scale and tucked away into a corner of a large conventional
map of the United States and Territories, so that it fails,
in this manner, to give an adequate idea of its real proportion—and
does not commonly impress the eye and mind, as it ought to,
at first sight. But a moment’s thoughtful observation shows the
vast landed extent between that extreme western point of Attoo
Island in the occident, and the boundary near Fort Simpson in the
orient, to be over 2,000 miles; while from this Alaskan initial post
at Simpson to Point Barrow, in the arctic, it covers the limit of
1,200 geographical miles.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The superficial magnitude of this region<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
is at once well appreciated when the largest States or Territories are
each held up in contrast.</p>

<p>The bewildering indentation and endless length of the coast, the
thousands of islands and islets, the numerous volcanoes and towering
peaks, and the maze of large and small rivers, make a comparison
of Alaska, in any other respect than that of mere superficial
area, wholly futile when brought into contrast with the rest
of the North American continent. Barred out as she is from close
communion with her new relationship and sisterhood in the American
Union by her remote situation, and still more so by the unhappiness
of her climate, she is not going to be inspected from
the platforms of flying express trains; and, save the little sheltered
jaunt by steamer from Puget Sound to Sitka and immediate vicinity,
no ocean-tourists are at all likely to pry into the lonely nooks
and harbors of her extended coasts, surf-beaten and tempest-swept
as they are every month in the year.</p>

<p>But, in the discharge of official duty, in the search for precious
metals, coal and copper, in the desire to locate profitable fishing
ventures, and in the interests of natural science, hundreds of energetic,
quick-witted Americans have been giving Alaska a very keen
examination during the last eighteen years. The sum of their
knowledge throws full understanding over the subject of Alaskan
life and resources, as viewed and appreciated from the American
basis; there is no difficulty in now making a fair picture of any
section, no matter how remote, or of conducting the reader into
the very presence of Alaska’s unique inhabitants, anywhere they
may be sought, and just as they live between Point Barrow and Cape
Fox, or Attoo and the Kinik mouth.</p>

<p>In going to Alaska to-day, the traveller is invariably taken into
the Sitkan district, and no farther; naturally he goes there and nowhere
beyond, for the best of all reasons: he can find no means of
transportation at all proper as regards his safety and comfort which
will convey him outside of the Alexander archipelago. To this
southeastern region of Alaska, however, one may journey every
month in the year from the waters of the Columbia River and
Puget Sound, in positive pleasure, on a seaworthy steamer fitted
with every marine adjunct conducive to the passenger’s comfortable
existence in transit; it is a land-locked sea-trip of over eighteen
hundred miles, made often to and from Sitka without tremor
enough on the part of the vessel even to spill a brimming glass of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
water upon the cabin table. If fortunate enough to make this trip
of eight or nine hundred miles up, and then down again, when the
fog is not omnipotent and rain not incessant, the tourist will record
a vision of earthly scenery grander than the most vivid imagination
can devise, and the recollection of its glories will never fade from
his delighted mind.</p>

<p>If, however, you desire to visit that great country to the westward
and the northwest, no approach can be made via Sitka—no
communication between that region and this portion of Alaska ever
takes place, except accidentally; the traveller starts from San Francisco
either in a codfishing schooner, a fur-trader’s sloop, or steamer,
and sails out into the vast Pacific on a bee-line for Kadiak or
Oonalashka; and, from these two chief ports of arrival and departure,
he laboriously works his way, if bent upon seeing the country,
constantly interrupted and continually beset with all manner of
hindrances to the progress of his journey by land and sea. These
physical obstructions in the path of travel to all points of interest
in Alaska, save those embraced in the Sitkan district, will bar out
and deprive thousands from ever beholding the striking natural
characteristics of a wonderful volcanic region in Cook’s Inlet and
the Aleutian chain of islands. When that time shall arrive in the
dim future which will order and sustain the sailing of steamers in
regular rotation of transit throughout the waters of this most interesting
section, then, indeed, will a source of infinite satisfaction
be afforded to those who love to contemplate the weird and the
sublime in nature; meanwhile, visits to that region in small sailing-craft
are highly risky and unpleasant—boisterous winds are chronic
and howling gales are frequent.</p>

<p>The beautiful and extraordinary features of preliminary travel
up the British Columbia coast will have prepared the mind for a
full enjoyment and comprehension of your first sight of Alaska.
If you are alert, you will be on deck and on good terms with the
officer in charge when the line is crossed on Dixon Sound, and the
low wooded crowns of Zayas and Dundas Islands, now close at hand,
are speedily left in the wake as the last landmarks of foreign soil.
To the left, as the steamer enters the beautiful water of Clarence
Straits, the abrupt, irregular, densely wooded shores of Prince of
Wales Island rise as lofty walls of timber and of rock, mossy and
sphagnous, shutting out completely a hasty glimpse of the great
Pacific rollers afforded in the Sound; while on the right hand you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
turn to a delighted contemplation of those snowy crests of the
towering coast range which, though thirty and fifty miles distant,
seem to fairly be in reach, just over and back of the rugged tree-clad
elevations of mountainous islands that rise abruptly from
the sea-canal in every direction. Not a gentle slope to the water
can be seen on either side of the vessel as you glide rapidly ahead;
the passage is often so narrow that the wavelets from the steamer’s
wheel break and echo back loudly on your ear from the various
strips of ringing rocky shingle at the base of bluffy intersections.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">Lodges in a Vast Wilderness.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If, by happy decree of fate, fog-banks do not shut suddenly
down upon your pleased vision, a rapid succession of islands and
myriads of islets, all springing out boldly from the cold blue-green
and whitish-gray waters which encircle their bases, will soon tend
to confuse and utterly destroy all sense of locality; the steamer’s
path seems to be in a circle, to lead right back to where she started
from, into another equally mysterious labyrinthine opening: then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
the curious idiosyncrasy possesses you by which you seem to see in
the scenery just ahead an exact resemblance to the bluffs, the summits
and the cascades which you have just left behind. Your emphatic
expression aloud of this belief will, most likely, arouse some
fellow-passenger who is an old voyageur, and he will take a guiding
oar: he will tell you that the numerous broad smooth tracks, cut
through the densely wooded mountain slopes from the snow lines
above abruptly down to the very sea below, are the paths of avalanches;
that if you will only crane your neck enough so as to look
right aloft to a certain precipice now almost hanging 3,000 feet
high and over the deck of the steamer, there you will see a few
small white specks feebly outlined against the grayish-red background
of the rocks—these are mountain goats; he tells you that
those stolid human beings who are squatting in a large dug-out
canoe are “Siwashes,” halibut-fishing—and as these savages stupidly
stare at the big “Boston” vessel swiftly passing, with uplifted
paddles or keeping slight headway, you return their gaze with interest,
and the next turn of the ship’s rudder most likely throws
into full view a “rancherie,” in which these Indians permanently
reside; your kindly guide then eloquently describes the village
and descants with much vehemence upon the frailties and shortcomings
of “Siwashes” in general—at least all old-stagers in this
country agree in despising the aboriginal man. On the steamer
forges through the still, unruffled waters of intricate passages,
now almost scraping her yard-arms on the face of a precipitous
headland—then rapidly shooting out into the heart of a lovely bay,
broad and deep enough to float in room and safety a naval flotilla
of the first class, until a long, unusually low, timbered point seems
to run out ahead directly in the track, when your guide, giving a
quick look of recognition, declares that Wrangel<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> town lies just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
around it, and you speedily make your inspection of an Alaskan
hamlet.</p>

<p>Owing to the dense forest-covering of the country, sections of
those clays and sands which rest in most of the hollows are seldom
seen, only here and there where the banks of a brook are cut out,
or where an avalanche has stripped a clear track through the jungle,
do you get a chance to see the soil in southeastern Alaska. There
are frequent low points to the islands, composed, where beaten upon
by the sea, of fine rocky shingle, which form a flat of greater or less
width under the bluffs or steep mountain or hill slopes, about three
to six feet above present high-water mark; they become, in most
cases, covered with a certain amount of good soil, upon which a
rank growth of grass and shrubbery exists, and upon which the Indians
love to build their houses, camp out, etc. These small flats,
so welcome and so rare in this pelagic wilderness, have evidently
been produced by the waves acting at different times in opposing
directions.</p>

surface cavities and pinnacles are concealed by snow and smoothed by frozen sleet</p>
</div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In all of those channels penetrating the mainland and intervening
between the numerous islands from the head of Glacier Bay and
Lynn Canal down to the north end of Vancouver’s Island, marks,
or glacial scratchings, indicative of the sliding of a great ice-sheet,
are to be found, generally in strict conformity with the trend of
the passages, wherever the rocks were well suited for their preservation;
and it is probable that the ice of the coast range, at one
time, reached out as far west as the outer islands which fringe the
entire Alaskan and British Columbian coast. Many of the boulders
on the beaches are plainly glaciated; and, as they are often
bunched in piles upon the places where found, they seem to have
not been disturbed since they were dropped there. The shores are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>everywhere abrupt and the water deep. The entire front of this
lofty coast-range chain, that forms the eastern Alaskan boundary
from the summit of Mt. St. Elias to the mouth of Portland Canal,
is glacier-bearing to-day, and you can scarcely push your way to the
head of any cañon, great or small, without finding an eternal ice-sheet
anchored there: careful estimation places the astonishing aggregate
of over 5,000 living glaciers, of greater or less degree, that
are silently but forever travelling down to the sea, in this region.</p>

<p>Those congealed rivers which take their origin in the flanks of
Mt. Fairweather<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and Mt. Crillon<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> are simply unrivalled in frigid
grandeur by anything that is lauded in Switzerland or the Himalayas,
though the vast bulk of the Greenland ice-sheets is, of course,
not even feebly approximated by them; the waters of the channels
which lead up from the ocean to the feet of these large glaciers of
Cross Sound and Lynn Canal, are full of bobbing icebergs that
have been detached from the main sheet, in every possible shape
and size—a detachment which is taking place at intervals of every
few moments, giving rise, in so doing, to a noise like parks of artillery;
but, of course, these bergs are very, very small compared
with those of Greenland, and only a few ever escape from the intricate
labyrinth of fiörds which are so characteristic of this Sitkan
district. An ice-sheet comes down the cañon, and as it slides into
the water of the canal or bay, wherever it may be, the pressure exerted
by the buoyancy of the partially submerged mass causes it to
crack off in the wildest lines of cleavage, and rise to the surface in
hundreds and thousands of glittering fragments; or again, it may
slide out over the water on a rocky bed, and, as it advances, break
off and fall down in thundering salvos, that ring and echo in the
gloomy cañons with awe-inspiring repetition. At the head and
around the sides of a large indentation of Cross Sound there are
no less than five immense, complete glaciers, which take their origin
between Fairweather and Crillon Mountains, each one reaching and
discharging into tide-water: here is a vast, a colossal glacier in full
exhibition, and so easy of access that the most delicate woman
could travel to, and view it, since an ocean-steamer can push to its
very sea-walls, without a moment’s serious interruption, where from
her decks may be scanned the singular spectacle of an icy river from
three to eight miles wide, fifty miles long, and varying in depth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
from fifty to five hundred feet. Between the west side of this frozen
bay and the water, all the ground, high and low, is covered by a
mantle of ice from one thousand to three thousand feet thick!</p>

<p>Here is an absolute realism of what once took place over the entire
northern continent—a vivid picture of the actual process of
degradation which the earth and its life were subjected to during
that long glacial epoch which bound up in its iron embrace of
death just about half of the globe.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This startling exhibition of a
mighty glacier with its cold, multitudinous surroundings in Cross
Sound, is alone well worth the time and cost of the voyage to behold
it, and it alone. There is not room in this narrative for further
dwelling upon that fascinating topic, for a full description of
such a gelid outpouring would in itself constitute a volume.</p>

<p>Throughout this archipelago of the Sitkan district, the strongest
tidal currents prevail: they flow at places like mill-races, and again
they scarcely interfere with the ship or canoe. The flood-tides usually
run northward along the outer coasts, and eastward in Dixon’s
Entrance; the weather, which is generally boisterous on the ocean
side of the islands, and on which the swell of the Pacific never
ceases to break with great fury, is very much subdued inside, and
the best indication of these tidal currents is afforded by the streaming
fronds of kelp that grow abundantly in all of these multitudinous
fiörds, and which are anchored securely in all depths, from a
few feet to that of seventy fathoms: when the tide is running through
some of those narrow passages, especially at ebb, it forms, with the
whip-like stems of sea-weed, a true rapid with much white water,
boiling and seething in its wild rushing; these alternations between
high and low water here are exceedingly variable—the spring-tides
at some places are as great as eighteen feet of rise, and a few miles
beyond, where the coast-expansion is great, it will not be more than
three or four feet.</p>

<p>Those baffling tides and the currents they create, together with
gusty squalls of rain or sleet, and irregular winds, render the
navigation of this inside passage wholly impracticable for sailing-vessels—they
gladly seek the open ocean where they can haul and
fill away to advantage even if it does blow “great guns;” the high
mural walls of the Alexander fiörds on both sides, usually, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
channels, cause the wind to either blow up them, or down: it literally
funnels through with terrific velocity when the “southeasters”
prevail, and nothing, not even the steamer, braves the fury of such
a storm.</p>

<p>The great growth of trees everywhere here, and the practical
impenetrability of these forests on foot, owing to brush and bushes,
all green and growing in tangled jungle, is caused by the comparative
immunity of this country from the scourge of forest fires: this
is due to a phenomenal dampness of the climate—it rains, rains, and
drizzles here two-thirds of the time. The heaviest rains are local,
usually occurring on the western or ocean slopes of the islands
where the sea-winds, surcharged with moisture, first meet a barrier
to their flow and are thrown up into the cooler regions of the
atmosphere. It will be often noticed, from the steamer, that while
heavy rain is falling on the lofty hills and mountains of Prince of
Wales Island, it is clear and bright directly over the Strait of
Clarence to the eastward, and not far distant. June and July are
the most agreeable seasons of the year in which to visit the Sitkan
district, as a rule.</p>

<p>Many thoughtful observers have questioned the truth of the
exuberant growth of forestry peculiar to this region, as being due
to that incessant rainfall mentioned above; no doubt, it is not
wholly so; but yet, if the ravages of fire ran through the islets
of the archipelago, as it does in the interior slightly to the eastward,
the same order of vegetation here would be soon noted as we
note it there to-day; everywhere that you ascend the inlets of the
mainland, the shores become steep and rocky, with no beach, or
very little; the trees become scrubby in appearance, and are
mingled with much dead wood (<em>brulé</em>). Scarcely any soil clothes
the slopes, and extensive patches of bare rock crop out frequently
everywhere.</p>

<p>Although the forest is omnipresent up to snow-line in this
great land-locked Sitkan district, yet it differs much in rankness of
growth and consequent value; it nowhere clothes the ridges or the
summits, which are 1,500 to 2,000 feet above tide-level; these peaks
and rocky elevations are usually bare, and show a characteristically
green-gray tint due to the sphagnous mosses and dwarfed brier and
bushes peculiar to this altitude, making an agreeable and sharp contrast
to that sombre and monotonous line of the conifers below. The
variety is limited, being substantially confined to three evergreens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
the spruce (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abies sitkensis</i> and <em>menziesii</em>), the hemlock (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abies mertensiana</i>),
and the cedar (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thuja gigantea</i>). The last is the most valuable,
is found usually growing near the shores, and never in great
quantities at any one place; wherever a sheltered flat place is found,
there these trees seem to grow in the greatest luxuriance. In the
narrower passages, where no seas can enter, the forest seems almost
to root in the beach, and its branches hang pendent to the tides,
and dip therein at high water. Where a narrow beach, capped
with warm sands and soil, occurs in sheltered nooks, vividly green
grass spreads down until it reaches the yellow sea-weed “tangle”
that grows everywhere in such places reached by high tide, for,
owing to the dampness of the climate, a few days exposure at neap-tides
fails to injure this fucoid growth. Ferns, oh! how beautiful
they are!—also grow most luxuriantly and even abundantly upon
the fallen, rotting tree-trunks, and even into the living arboreal
boughs, and green mosses form great club-like masses on the
branches.</p>

<p>Large trunks of this timber, overthrown and dead, become here
at once perfect gardens of young trees, moss, and bushes, even
though lying high above the ground and supported on piles of yet
earlier windfall. Similar features characterize the littoral forests
of the entire land-locked region of the northwest coast, from Puget
Sound to the mouth of Lynn Canal.</p>

<p>In addition to these overwhelmingly dominant conifers already
specified, a few cottonwoods and swamp-maples and alders are scattered
in the jungle which borders the many little streams and the
large rivers like the Stickeen, Tahko, and Chilkat. Crab-apples
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrus rivularis</i>) form small groves on Prince of Wales Island, where
the beach is low and capped with good soil. Then on the exposed,
almost bare rocks of the western hilltops of the islands of the archipelago,
a scrub pine (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinus contorta</i>) is found; it also grows in
small clumps here and there just below the snow-line on the mountains
generally. Berries abound; the most important being the
sal-lal (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gaultheria shallow</i>)—they are eaten fresh in great quantities,
and are also dried for use in winter—and another small raspberry
(<em>Rubus sp.</em>), a currant (<em>Ribes sp.</em>), and a large juicy whortleberry.
Of course these berries do not have the flavor or body which we
prize at home in our small fruits of similar character—but up here
they, in the absence of anything better or as good, are eaten with
avidity and relish, even by the white travellers who happen to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>around when the fruit is ripe; wild strawberries appear in sheltered
nooks; a wild gooseberry too is found, but it, like the crab-apple of
Prince of Wales Island, is not a favorite—it is drastic.</p>

</figure>

<p>We find in many places throughout this district highland moors,
which constitute the level plateau-summits of ridges and mountain
foothills; these areas are always sparsely timbered, covered by a
thick carpet of sphagnous heather, and literally brilliant in June
and July with the spangled radiance of an extensive variety of
flowering annuals and biennials. In these moorland mantles, which
are usually soaked full of moisture so as to be fairly spongy under
foot, cranberries flourish, of excellent flavor, and quite abundant,
though, compared with our choice Jersey and Cape Cod samples,
they are very small.</p>

<p>Certainly the scenery of this Venetian wilderness of Lower Alaska
is wonderful and unrivalled—the sounds, the gulfs, bays, fiörds,
and river-estuaries are magnificent sheets of water, and the snow-capped
peaks, which spring abruptly from their mirrored depths,
give the scene an ever-changing aspect. At places the ship seems
to really be at sea, then she enters a canal whose lofty walls of syenite,
slate, and granite shut out the light of day, and against which
her rigging scrapes, and the passenger’s hand may almost touch—a
hundred thousand sparkling streams fall in feathery cascades,
adown their mural heights, and impetuous streams beat themselves
into white foam as they leap either into the eternal depths of the
Pacific or its deep arms.</p>

<p>Probably no one point in the Sitkan archipelago is invested by
nature with a grander, gloomier aspect than is that region known
as the eastern shore of Prince Frederick’s Sound, where the mountains
of the mainland drop down abruptly to the seaside; here a
spur of the coast range, opposite Mitgon Islet, presents an unusually
dreadful appearance, for it rises to a vast height with an inclination
toward and over the water: the serrated, jagged summits are
loaded with an immense quantity of ice and snow, which, together
with the overhanging masses of rock, seems to cause its sea-laved
base to fairly totter under that stupendous weight overhead; the
passage beneath it, in the canoe of a traveller, is simply awful in its
dread suggestion, and few can refrain from involuntary shuddering
as they sail by and gaze upward.</p>

<p>A word about the Sitkan climate: you are not going to be very
cold here even in the most severe of winters, nor will you complain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
of heat in the most favorable of summers; it maybe best epitomized
by saying in brief that the weather is such that you seldom ever find
a clean cake of ice frozen in the small fresh-water ponds six inches
thick; and you never will experience a summer warm enough to
ripen a head of oats. The first impression usually made upon the
visitor is that it is raining, raining all the time, not a pouring rain
or shower, then clearing up quickly, but a steady “driz-driz-drizzle”;
it rained upon the author in this manner seventeen consecutive
days in October, 1866, accompanied by winds from all points
of the compass. Therefore, by contrast, the relatively clear and dry
months of June and July in the archipelago are really delightful—clear
and pleasant in the sun, and cool enough for fires indoors—then
you have about eighteen hours of sunshine and six hours of twilight.</p>

<p>It is very seldom that the zero-point is ever recorded at tide-level
during winter here, though in January, 1874, it fell to —7° Fah.; the
thermometer at no time in the winter preceding registered lower
than 11° above. A late blustering spring and an early, vigorous
winter often join hands over a very backward summer—about once
or twice every five years; these are the backward seasons; then the
first frost in the villages and tidal bottoms occurs about the 28th
to 31st of October, soon followed by the rain turning to snow, being
as much as three feet deep on the level at times. Severe thunderstorms,
with lightning, often take place during these violent snowfalls
in the winter—strange to say they are not heard or seen in the
summer! Snow and rain and sleet continue till the end of April—sometimes
as late as the 10th of May, before giving way to the enjoyable
season of June and July. Then again the mild winters are
marked by no frost to speak of—perhaps the coldest period will have
been in November, little or no snow, six or seven inches at the most,
and much clear and bracing weather.</p>

<p>The average rainfall in the Sitkan district is between eighty-four
and eighty-six inches annually—it is a very steady average, and
makes no heavier showing than that presented by the record kept
on the coast of Oregon and Vancouver’s Island. A pleasant season
in the archipelago will give the observer about one hundred fair
days; the rest of the year will be given over to rain, snow, and foggy-shrouds,
which wet like rain itself.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> A most careful search during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the last hundred years has failed to disclose in all the extent of this
Sitkan region an arable or bottom-land piece large enough to represent
a hundred-acre farm, save in the valley of the Tahkoo River,
where for forty or fifty miles a low, level plateau extends, varying
in width from a few rods to half a mile, between the steep mountain
walls that compass it about. Red-top and wild timothy grasses grow
here in the most luxuriant style, as they do for that matter everywhere
else in the archipelago on little patches of open land along
the streams and sea-beaches; the humidity of the climate makes
the cost of curing hay, however, very great, and prevents the profitable
ranging of cattle.</p>

<p>We have strayed from the landing which we made at Wrangel,
and, returning to the contemplation of that town, candor compels
an exclamation of disappointment—it is not inviting, for we see
nothing but a straggling group of hastily erected shanties and frame
store-houses, which face a rickety wharf and a dirty trackway just
above the beach-level; a dense forest and tangled jungle spring up
like a forbidding wall at the very rear of the houses, which are supplemented
by a number of Indian rancheries that skirt the beach
just beyond, and hug the point; this place, however, though now in
sad decline, was a place of much life and importance during 1875-79,
when the Cassiar gold-excitement in British Columbia, via the
Stickeen River, drew many hundreds of venturesome miners up here,
and through Wrangel <em>en route</em>. This forlorn spot was still earlier
a centre of even greater stir and activity, for, in 1831, the Russians,
fearing that they would be forced into war with the Hudson’s Bay
people, made a quick movement, came down here from Sitka, and
built a bastioned log fortress right where the present Siwash rancheries
stand. Lieutenant Zarenbo, who engineered the construction,
called his work “Rédoute Saint Dionys,” and had scarcely got under
cover when he was attacked by several large bateaux, manned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
by employés of the great English company; he fired upon them,
beat them off, and held his own so well that the grateful Baron Von
Wrangel, who then was governor-in-chief, bestowed the name of
the plucky officer upon the large, rugged island which overshadows
the scene of the conflict, and which it bears upon every chart to-day.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Again, in 1862, the solitude of Wrangel was broken by the
sudden eruption of over two thousand British Columbia and Californian
miners, who rushed up the Stickeen River on a gold
“excitement.” Quite a fleet of sail and steam-vessels hung about
the place for a brief season, when the flurry died out, and the restless
gold-hunters fled in search of other diggings, taking all their
belongings with them.</p>

<p>The steamer does not tarry long at Wrangel; a few packages
fall upon the shaky wharf, the captain never leaves the bridge, and
in obedience to his tinkling bell, the screw scarce has paused ere it
starts anew, and the vessel soon heads right about and west, out to
the open swell of the great Pacific; but it takes six or seven hours
of swift travel over the glassy surface of Clarence Strait to pass the
rough heads of Kuprianov Island on the right, flanked by the
sombre, densely wooded elevations of Prince of Wales on the left.
The lower, yet sharper spurs of the straggling Kou forests force
our course here directly to the south. It is said that more than
fifteen hundred islands, big and little, stud this archipelago from
Cape Disappointment to Cross Sound. You will not attempt to
count them, but readily prefer to believe it is so. From the great
bulk of Vancouver’s Land to the tiny islet just peeping above
water, they are all covered to the snow-line from the sea-level with
an olive-green coniferous forest—islands right ahead, islands on
every side, islands all behind. You stand on deck and wonder
where the egress from the unruffled inland lake is to be as you
enter it; no possible chance to go ahead much faster, is your constant
thought, which keeps following every sharp turn of the vessel
as she rapidly swings right about here, there, and everywhere, in
following the devious path of this weird course to her destination.</p>

<p>Unless the fog shuts down very thick, the darkness of night
does not impede the steamer’s steady progress, for the pilot sees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the mountain tops loom up darker against the blue-black sky, and
with unerring certainty he guides the helm. When the ship is
running through tide-rapids in the night, the boiling phosphorescence
of the foaming waters, as they rush noisily under our keel,
gives a fresh zest to the novelty of the cruise, and the pilot’s cries
of command ring out in hoarse echoes over the surging tumult
below; meanwhile, the passengers anxiously and nervously watch
the unquiet turns of the trembling vessel—then suddenly the helm
is put up, and the steamer fairly bounds out of still water and the
leeward of Coronation Island, into the rhythmic roll of the vast billows
of the Pacific, which toss her in strange contrast to the even
keel that has characterized our long, land-locked sea-voyage up to
this moment. The wrinkled, rugged nose of Cape Ommaney looms
right ahead in the north, and soon we are well abreast of the mountainous
front to the west coast of Baranov Island, running swiftly
into Sitka Sound.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Cape Ommaney is a very remarkable promontory; it is a steep,
bluffy cliff, with a round, high rocky islet, lying close by and under
it. The eastern shore of that cape takes a very sharp northerly direction,
and thus makes this southern extremity of Baranov Island
an exceedingly narrow point of land. An unlucky sailor, Isaac
Wooden, fell overboard from Vancouver’s ship the <em>Discovery</em>, when
abreast of it and homeward bound, Sunday, August 24, 1794, and—was
drowned, after having safely passed through all the perils
of that most remarkable voyage, extended as it was over a period
of four consecutive years’ absence from home. The rock bears the
odd name “Wooden” in consequence.</p>

<p>The location of New Archangel, or Sitka village, is now conceded
to be the one of the greatest natural beauty and scenic effect
that can be found in all Alaska. The story of its occupation by the
Russians is a recitation of violent deeds and unflinching courage
on the part of the iron-willed Baranov and his obedient servants:
he led the way down here from Kadiak first, of all white men, in
1799, after hearing the preliminary report of exploration made two
years previously by his lieutenant, Captain James Shields, an English
adventurer and shipbuilder, who entered the service of the
Russian Company in the Okotsk. Baranov, though small in stature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
was possessed of unusual physical endurance and muscular strength.
He was absolutely fearless; he never allowed any obstacle, no matter
how serious, which the elements or savage men were perpetually
raising, to check his advances. He loved to travel and explore, and
possessed rare executive or governing power over his rude and
boisterous followers. He soon realized that the establishment of
the headquarters of the company at St. Paul, Kadiak Island, was
disadvantageous, and quickly resolved to settle himself permanently
in the Bay of Sitka, or Norfolk Sound, where he could communicate
with the vessels of other nations and purchase supplies of
them. Late in the autumn of 1799 he sailed to this port in the
brig <em>Catherine</em>, accompanied by a large fleet of Aleutian and Kadiak
sea-otter hunters with their bidarkas, or skin-canoes. So
abundant were sea-otters then, now so rare, that, with the assistance
of these native hunters, he secured over fifteen hundred prime
otter-skins in less than a month; then satisfied with the trading resources
of the locality, Baranov began the construction of a stockaded
post, the site selected for which was on the main island, about
six miles to the northward of the Sitkan town-site of to-day. During
the winter of 1799-1800 he and his whole force were busily engaged
in the erection of substantial log houses and the surrounding
stockade at this location. In the spring, two American fur-trading
vessels made their appearance here, and the owners began to carry
on a brisk traffic with the native Sitkans, right under the eyes of
Baranov. Knowing that this must be stopped, the energetic Russian
hastened back to Kadiak and set the machinery in motion to
that end. But his absence in the meantime from Sitka was improved
upon by the Koloshians, who, acting in preconcerted plan,
utterly destroyed the post. These savages on a certain day, when
most of the garrison was far outside of the stockade, hunting and
fishing, rushed in, several thousand of them, upon a few armed
men, surrounded the block-house, assailed it from all sides at once,
and soon forced an entrance. They massacred the defenders to a
man, including the commander, Medvaidniekov, and carried off more
than three thousand sea-otter pelts from the warehouses.</p>

<p>During this wild and bloody fight an English ship was lying at
anchor far down the harbor, some ten miles from the scene; three
Russians and five Aleutes only, out of the hunting parties absent at the
time of the attack, managed to secrete themselves in the woods, and
hide until they could gain the decks and protection of this vessel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
and thus acquaint her captain, Barber, of the outrage; he contrived
to entice two of the leading Sitkan chiefs on board of his ship,
plied them with drink, and soon had them securely ironed, and
then, having quite a battery of guns, he was able to make his own
terms for their release; this was done after the surrender of eighteen
women (captured outside of the stockade) and 2,000 sea-otter skins
was made to Barber, who at once sailed for Kadiak. Here the
British seaman demanded from Baranov the salvage of 50,000
rubles for rescuing his men and women and property; with this
demand the Russian could not or would not comply; but, after
many days in amicable argument, Captain Barber received and
accepted 10,000 rubles in full settlement.</p>

<p>While the lurid light of the burning wreck of this first Sitkan post
was flashing over the sound, and the Koloshes were howling and
dancing around it in their fiendish exultation, nearly two hundred
Aleutian hunters were surprised and slaughtered at various points in
the vicinity, and a party of over one hundred of these simple natives
perished almost to a man, on the same day, from eating poisonous
mussels which they detached from the rocks in the strait that separates
Baranov Island from Chichagov; that canal still bears the
name commemorative of this dreadful accident—it is called “Pogeebshie”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
or “Destruction” Strait.</p>

<p>The enraged Russian manager was unable, by reason of a complicated
flood of troubles with his subordinates elsewhere, to revisit
Sitka until the spring of 1804; he then came down from Kadiak in
a squadron consisting of three small sloops, in all considerably less
than 100 tons burden; these craft he had built and fitted out in
Prince William Sound and Yakootat Bay during the preceding
winter. He had with him forty Russians and three hundred Aleutian
sea-otter hunters. With this small force the indomitable man
resolved to attack and subjugate a body of not less than five or six
thousand fierce, untamed savages, who were flushed with their cruel
successes, and eager to shed more blood. He was unexpectedly
strengthened by the sudden appearance in the bay of the <em>Neva</em>,
400 tons, which had sailed from London to Kadiak, and arrived
just after Baranov’s departure, but Captain Lissiansky, learning
of the object of his trip, determined to assist in rebuilding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
Sitkan post and to punish the Indians, so he sailed at once for the
place.</p>

<p>Baranov found the Sitkans all entrenched behind a huge stockade
that was thrown up on the same lofty rocky site of the governor’s
castle in the town to-day. They reviled him and defied
him, taunted him with his misfortunes, and easily succeeded in exciting
him to a ferocious attack, in which, despite his demoniacal
bravery, he was beaten off at first with the loss of eleven white
sailors and hunters, he himself badly wounded, together with
Lieutenants Arbuzov and Povalishin. The darkness of a violent rain
and sleet storm, with night close at hand, caused a cessation, for
the time, of further hostilities, but in the morning the ship and the
little sloops approached the beach and opened upon the startled
savages a hot bombardment—the splintering of their log bastions
and the terrible, unwonted noise accompanying, was too much for
their self-control, and though, during the whole day they refused to
fly, yet when night again came round they abandoned their fortification,
and retreated silently and quickly in canoes to Chatham Strait.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">[<em>Wholly remodelled and rebuilt by his successors.</em>]</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Russians then took possession of the present town-site of
Sitka. The rocky eminence which the savages had so bravely held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
was cleared of their rude barricades, and the foundations were laid
then to the castle that still stands so conspicuous. Around this
nucleus the Russian settlement soon sprang up in a few months,
a high stockade was then erected between the village and the
Indian rancheries, which still stands in part to-day; it was bastioned
and fortified with an armament of three-pounder brass guns. From
this time on the supremacy of the Russians was never questioned
by the Indians of the Sitkan archipelago. The reckless daring of
Baranov, evinced by his personal bearing at the head of a handful of
men in repeated attacks upon the castle-rock encampment was exaggerated
by the savages in repetition among themselves, until his
name to them became synonymous with a charmed life and supreme
authority. Baranov himself called this spot the final headquarters
of the Russian American Company, and henceforth it became so,
and it was officially known as New Archangel; but the tribal name
of the savages who lived just outside the stockade fence was
“Seet-kah,” and soon the present designation was used by all visitors
and Russians alike, brevity and euphony making it “Sitka.”</p>

<p>It is not probable that the beautiful vistas of this sound influenced
Baranov in the slightest when he selected it for his base of
operations; but there must have been mornings and evenings when
this hardy man looked at them with some responsive pleasure, for
certainly the human being who could remain insensible to their
scenic glories must be one without a drop of warm blood in his veins.
Those high-peaked summits of the Baranov Mountains, which overshadow
the town on the east, destroy, in a great measure, the effects
of sunrise; but the transcendent glow of sundown colors is the glow
that floods the crown and base of Mt. Edgecumb on the western
horizon of the bay, and repeats its radiance in tipping with golden
gild the host of tiny islets which stud the flashing waters, to burn
in lingering brightness on the peaks of Verstova and her sister hills,
when all else is in darkness or its shades around about.</p>

<p>The most characteristic and expressive single view of Sitka is that
one afforded from Japan Island, which is close by and right opposite
the town: the place was in its greatest architectural grandeur
prior to the departure of the Russians, in 1866. The lofty peak
which rises abruptly back of the village is Verstova, to the bald
summit of which a champagne picnic by the Russians was religiously
made every summer. Although the mountain is slightly
under three thousand feet in altitude and seemingly right at hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
yet the journey to its crest is one that taxes the best physical energies
of strong men. The forest is so dense, so damp, the underbrush
so thick and so tangled, that the walk requires a supreme
bodily effort, if the trip be made up there and back in the same day.</p>

<p>This view from “Yahponskie” gives an exceedingly good idea of
the ultra-mountainous character of Baranov Island, much better
than any power of verbal description can. It also illustrates the
futility of land travel in the Sitkan archipelago, and affords ample
reason for the utter absence of all roads, even footpaths, in that entire
region; it also preserves the somewhat imposing front which
the extensive warehouses and official quarters of the Russian American
Company presented in 1866, before their transfer to us, and
the ravages of fire and that decay which has since well-nigh destroyed
them; it recalls the shipyards and the brass and iron foundries
and machine-shops that have not even a vestige of their existence
on that ground to-day, and it outlines a larger Indian village
than the one we find there now.</p>

<p>For the objects of self-protection and comfort the Russians
built large apartment-houses or flats, and lived in them at Sitka.
Several of these dwellings were 150 feet in length by 50 to 80
feet in depth, three stories high, with huge roof-attics. They
were constructed of big spruce logs, smoothly trimmed down
to 12’ × 12’ timbers. These were snugly dovetailed at the corners,
and the expansive roof covered with sheet-iron. The exteriors
were painted a faint lemon-yellow, while the iron roof everywhere
glistened with red-ochre. The windows were uniformly small, but
fitted very neatly in tasteful casemates, and usually with double
sashes. Within, the floors were laid of whipsawed planks, tongued
and grooved by hand and highly polished. The inner walls were
“ceiled” up on all sides and overhead by light boards, and usually
papered showily. The heavy, unique Russian furniture was moved
in upon rugs of fur and tapestry, and then these people bade defiance
to the elements, no matter how unruly, and led therein the
most enjoyable of physical lives. The united testimony of all travellers,
who were many, and who shared the hospitality of the Russians
at Sitka, is one invariable tribute to the excellence and the
comfort of their indoor living at New Archangel.</p>

</figure>

<p>The shipyard of Sitka was as complete as any similar establishment
in the Russian Empire. It was actively employed in boat and
sail-vessel building, being provided with all sorts of workshops and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>materials. Experiments were also instituted and prosecuted, to
some extent, in making bricks, so much prized in the construction
of the big conventional Russian “stoves,” the turning of wooden-ware,
the manufacture of woollen stuffs from the crude material
brought up from California; but the great cost of importing skilled
labor from far-distant Russia, and the relative expense of maintaining
it here, caused the financial failure of all these undertakings.
Much money was also wasted in attempting to make iron out of the
different grades of ore found in many sections of the country. The
only real advantage that the company ever reaped from the workshops
at Sitka was that which accrued to it from the manufacture
of agricultural implements, which it sold to the indolent rancheros
of California and Mexico. Thousands of the primitive ploughshares
and rude hoes and rakes used in those countries then were made
here; also axes, hatchets, and knives were turned out by industrious
Muscovites for Alaskan post-trading. The foundry was engaged
most of the time in making the large iron and brazen bells which
every church and mission from Bering’s Straits to Mexico called
for. Most of these bells are still in use or existence, and give ample
evidence of skilful workmanship, and of this early development
of a unique industry on our northern coast.</p>

<p>Naturally enough the contrast of what the Russian Sitka was,
with what the American Sitka is to-day, is a striking one: then a
force of six or eight hundred white men, with wives and families,
busily engaged as above sketched, directed by a retinue of fifty or
sixty subalterns of the governor, lived right under the windows of
his castle and within the stockade; then the Greek-Catholic Bishop
of all Alaska also resided there, with a staff of fifteen ordained
priests and scores of deacons all around him, maintained regardless
of expense, at this time, by the Imperial Government in that ecclesiastical
pomp so peculiar to this Oriental Church—then a fleet of
twelve to fifteen sailing-vessels, from ships in size to mere sloops,
with two ocean-going steamers, made the waters of the bay their
regular rendezvous, their hardy crews assisting to give life and stir
to the town, shore, and streets—all this ordered by the concentration
of the entire trade and commerce of Alaska at New Archangel.</p>

<p>Now, how different! As you step ashore you scarcely pause to
notice the handful of whites who have assembled on the wharf, but
at once the impression of general decay is made upon your mind;
the houses, mostly the original Russian buildings, are settling here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
there, and everywhere, rotting on their foundations, and scarcely
more than half of them even occupied, while the combined population
of some three hundred souls in number peers at you from every
corner. The great majority of these people are the half-breeds, or
“Creoles,” or the descendants of Indians and Russians; some of
them are tall and well-formed, and a few of them good-looking, but
they are nearly all short-statured, abject, and apathetic. Yet in
one respect Sitka has vastly improved under American supremacy—she
has become clean; for although the Russian officers kept the
immediate surroundings of their residences in good order, still
they never looked after the conduct of the rest of the town. There
were, in their time, no defined streets or sidewalks, and mud and
filth were knee-deep and most noisome. Our military authorities,
however, who first took charge immediately after the transfer, and
who are proverbial for cleanliness and neatness in garrison life,
made the sanitary reformation of Sitka an instant and imperative
duty; the slimy walks were soon planked, the muddy streets were
gravelled and curbed, the main street especially widened, the oldest
houses were repainted, and where dilapidated, repaired, and things
put into shape most thoroughly; they also graded and sauntered
over the first wagon-road ever opened in Alaska, which they constructed,
from the steamers’ landing under the castle, back bordering
the bay to Indian River, over a mile in length.</p>

<p>But the pomp and circumstance of the old castle—still the
most striking artificial feature now in all Alaska—will never wake
to the echoes of that proud and lavish hospitality which once
reigned within its walls, and when the flashing light in its lofty
cupola carried joy out over the dark waters of the sound to the
hearts of inbound mariners, who came safely into anchor by its
gleaming—the elegant breakfasts and farewell dinners given to
favored guests, where the glass, the plate, viands, wines and appointments
were fit for regal entertainment itself—all these have
vanished, and naught but the uneven, slowly settling floors, warped
doors, and general mouldiness of the present hour greets the inquiring
eye. So heavy are its timbers, and so faithfully were they
keyed together, that in spite of neglect, the ravages of decay and
frequent vandalism, yet, in all likelihood, an age will elapse ere the
structure is removed by these destroying agencies now so actively
at work upon it. Moved by the desire to preserve the salient
features of this historical structure, the author made, during one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
clear June day, a pre-Raphaelitic drawing of it,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> as his vessel swung
at anchor under its shadows; in it the reader will observe that the
rocky eminence which it crowns is covered to the very foundations
and to the promenade cribbing that surrounds them, with a thick
growth of alders, stunted spruces, and other indigenous vegetation.
That walk around the castle, which was artificially reared
thereon, gives a most commanding view of everything, over all
objects in the town and Indian village, and sweeps the landscape
and the sound. Another picture from the promenade walk under
the flagstaff is also given, in order that a faint effect may be conveyed
to the reader of the exceeding beauty of the island-studded
Bay of Sitka. Descending and standing immediately under the
castle on the beach, to the right you have a perfect Alpine scene
as you look east along the pebbly shore to the living green flanks
of Mount Verstova, which carry your gaze up quickly over rolling
purplish curtains of fog to the snowy crest of it, and other lofty
crests <em>ad infinitum</em>, over far beyond. The little trading stores on
the left in this view hide the track so well known in Sitka as the
“Governor’s Walk,” for this is the only direction out to the saw-mill
in the middle distance, in which the earth lies smooth and
dry enough in all this archipelago for a clean mile-jaunt. These
still blue and green waters are alive with food-fishes, while the
dense coverts on the mountains harbor grouse and venison in
lavish supply; the oyster and the lobster you have not, but the
clam and the crab are here in overwhelming abundance and excellence.
“Ah!” you exclaim, “if it were not for this eternal rain,
this everlasting damp precipitation, how delightful this place would
be to live in!”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> When the Cassiar mines in British Columbia were prosperous, Wrangel
was a very busy little transfer-station—the busiest spot in Alaska; then between
four and five thousand miners passed through every spring and fall as
they went up to and came down from the diggings on the Stickeen tributaries
above; they left a goodly share, if not most, of their earnings among the
store and saloon keepers of Wrangel. The fort is now deserted—the town
nearly so; the whole place is rapidly reverting to the Siwashes. Government
buildings erected here by the U. S. military authorities, which cost the public
treasury $150,000, were sold in 1877, when the troops were withdrawn,
for a few hundreds. The main street is choked with decaying logs and
stumps. A recent visitor declares, upon looking at the condition of this place
in the summer of 1883: “Fort Wrangel is a fit introduction to Alaska. It is
most weird and wild of aspect. It is the key-note to the sublime and lonely
scenery of the north. It is situated at the foot of conical hills, at the head
of a gloomy harbor, filled with gloomy islands. Frowning cliffs, beetling
crags, stretch away on all sides surrounding it. Lofty promontories guard it,
backed by range after range of sharp, volcanic peaks, which in turn are lost
against lines of snowy mountains. It is the home of storms. You see that
in the broken pines on the cliff-sides, in the fine wave-swept rocks, in the
lowering mountains. There is not a bright touch in it—not in its straggling
lines of native huts, each with a demon-like totem beside it, nor in the fort,
for that is dilapidated and fast sinking into decay.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">Our people living now in the Sitkan district are engaged either in
general trading with the Indians, in prospecting for “mineral,” or
actively mining; and, also, in a small fashion, in canning salmon
and rendering dog-fish and herring oil. Perhaps we can give a fair
idea of the traders by introducing the reader to one of them and
his establishment just as we find him at Sitka. In a small
frame one-story house, not usually touched by paint, the trader
shelters a general assortment of notions and groceries, but principally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
tobacco, molasses, blankets of all sizes and colors, cotton
prints and cheap rings, beads, looking-glasses, etc.; he stands
behind a rude counter, with these wares displayed to best advantage
on the rough shelves at his back; a wood-burning stove
diffuses a genial glow, but no chairs or benches are convenient. A
“Siwash”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and his squaw deliberately and gravely enter. The
Indian slowly looks up and down the room, and then proceeds to
price every object within his vision, no matter whether he has the
least idea of purchasing or not; this is the prelude and invariable
habit of a Sitkan Indian, and it arouses an immense amount of
suppressed profanity on the part of the outwardly courteous trader.
But our savage has come in this time bent upon buying, and selling
also; his female partner has a bundle carefully done up under her
blanket, and which she wholly concealed when she squatted down
on her haunches the moment after entering the door; she also
has a number of small silver coins in her mouth, for, funny as it may
seem, this worthy pair have carefully agreed upon what they shall
spend in the store before coming in; so the woman has taken out
from the leathern purse which hangs on her breast and under her
chemise, the exact amount, and, returning the pouch to the privacy
of her bosom, she places the available coin in her mouth for safe
keeping <em>ad interim</em>.</p>

<p>Finally the Indian, in the course of half an hour, or perhaps a
whole half-day in preliminary skirmishing, boldly reaches down for
his bundle in the squaw’s charge; then having, by so doing, given
the trader to fully understand that he has something to sell, as well
as desiring to buy, he reaches out for the groceries, the cloth, the
tobacco, or whatever he may have fully decided to purchase; a
long argument at once ensues as to the bottom cash price, and in
every case of doubt the squaw decides; all the articles are done
up in brown paper and neatly tied with attractive parti-colored
twine. Then the dusky woman arises, with an indescribably vacant
stare, bends over the counter and lets the jingling silver drop upon
it, pausing just a moment until the tired but triumphant trader
counts and sweeps it, still moist, into his till.</p>

<p>Now the Siwash, having bought, proceeds to sell, and he does
it in his own peculiar way. He unrolls his package of furs; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
eloquently discourses as he strokes each pelt out on the counter, in
turn praising its size and its quality; the trader in the meanwhile
sharply keeps one eye on the savage and one eye on the furs, and,
after the story of their capture and quality has been told over the
third or fourth time, he asks, “How much?” The crafty hunter
promptly demands more than they would retail at in London; the
trader answers with great emphasis and a most disgusted head-shake,
“no;” he then offers just half or one-third the sum named,
whereupon the Indians, affecting great contempt, both shout out
“klaik!” which sounds like Poe’s “Raven”—roll up their furs and
hustle out in a huff, still repeating, in sonorous unison, “klaik,
klaik”—(no, no). Then they go to the rival trader’s establishment,
and to all of them in turn, even if there are half a dozen, not
leaving one of them unvisited; they finally finish the rounds in the
course of a week or two, and then quietly march back to that
trader who offered the most, and laying their peltries down in
perfect silence on his counter, hold out a grimy hand for the exact
sum he had previously proffered.</p>

<p>In this shrewd and aggravating manner does the simple untutored
savage of the northwest coast deal with white traders—are
they swindled, do you think? From the beginning to the end of
any transaction you may have with an Alaskan Indian you will be
met with the keenest understanding on his part of the full value in
dollars and cents of whatsoever he may do for you or sell. When,
however, the Hudson Bay or the Russian Company held an exclusive
franchise in this district, then the Indian had no alternative
but the single post-trader’s terms; and then the white man’s
profits were enormous. But now, with the keen rivalry of competing
stores, the trader barely makes a living anywhere in Alaska
to-day, while the Indian gets the best of every bargain—vastly
better compared with his former experience.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">The Sitkan Chimes.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The fur trade, however, in the whole Sitkan district is now of
small commercial importance; thirty or forty thousand dollars annually
will more than express its gross value. This great shrinkage
is due to the practical extermination of the sea-otter in these
waters, while the brown and black bears, the mink and marten, the
beaver and the land-otter skins secured in this archipelago and its
mainland coast are not highly valued by furriers, inasmuch as the
climate here is never cold enough to give them that depth and
gloss of fur desired and so characteristic of those animals which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
are taken, away back in the interior, where the temperature ranges
from 20° to 40° below zero for months at a time. In early days,
the Sitkan savages acted as middlemen, receiving these choice peltries
from the back-country Indians, who were never permitted by
the coast tribes to come down to the sea—and then trading the
stock anew in their own right over to the Russian and English
posts, they reaped a large advance. Now, however, the independent
white trader penetrates to the interior himself, and the Alaskan
Siwashes mourn the loss of those rich commissions which once
accrued to their emolument and consequence. The irruption, also,
of the restless, tireless, wandering miners throughout Alaska and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
British Columbia, who, prospecting in every ravine and cañon, never
let an opportunity pass to trade and trap for good furs, has also contributed
to this total stagnation of the business in the Sitkan region.</p>

<p>The finest structure in Sitka to-day is the Greek church, which
alone did not pass from the custody of its original owners at the
time of the transfer. This building has been kept in repair, so that
its trim and unique architecture never fails to arrest the visitor’s
attention and challenge inspection, especially of the interior. We
find the service of the church rich and profuse in silverware, candelabra,
ornately framed pictures—oil-paintings of the saints—and
rich vestments; two priests officiate, a reader chants rapid automatism,
and a choir of small boys respond in shrill but pleasing
orisons; instrumental music is banished from the services of the
Greek Church, and so are pews, chairs, and hassocks; the Creole
congregation, men, women, and children, stand and kneel and cross
themselves, erect and bowed, for hours and hours at a time during
certain festivals, never moving a step from their positions. The
men stand on the right side of the vestibule, facing the altar,
while the women all stand by themselves, on the left, the children
at option as they enter. No one looks to the one side or the other,
but every face is riveted upon the priest, who says little, and is
busily engaged in symbolic worship.</p>

<p>The Indians do not enter here, nor did they ever; for them the
Russians erected a small chapel, which still stands on the site of its
first location; it is built against the inner side of the stockade,
and, like the old Lutheran church lower down in the town, it is fast
going to ruin; the door is secured by one of those remarkable
Muscovitic padlocks—it is eight or ten inches long, five or six wide,
and three deep; these singular locks must be seen to be appreciated
in all of their clumsy strength. This little faded place of savage
worship was the scene in 1855 of the second and last stand ever
made by the Sitkan Indians in revolt against the Russians. Those
savages, brooding over some petty indignities received from the
whites, became suddenly inflamed with passion, and a swarm of
armed warriors from the adjacent rancheries rushed, one dusky
evening, upon the fortified palisade surrounding the village, and
began to cut and tear it down. The Russians opened their brass
batteries of grape and round-shot upon the infuriated, yelling
natives from the several block-houses which commanded the stockade,
but the Siwashes returned the fire fearlessly with their smoothbore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
muskets, and succeeded in getting possession of this chapel,
behind the stout logs of which they were sheltered and able to do
deadly execution with their rifles in picking off the Russian officers
and men, as they hurried to and from the bastions and through the
streets of the town. When, however, one of the company’s vessels
hauled off the beach opposite the Indian village, and trained her
guns upon it and its people, the savages humbly sued for mercy,
and have remained in abasement ever since.</p>

</figure>

<p>Contemplating this Indian church at Sitka, which has stood here
for nearly three quarters of a century, and then glancing over it
and into the savage settlement that nestles in its shadow, it is impossible
to refrain from expressing a few thoughts which arise to
my mind over the subject of the Indian in regard to his conversion
to the faith and practices of our higher civilization. Nearly a
whole century has been expended, here, of unflagging endeavor to
better and to change the inherent nature of these Indians—its full
result is before our eyes. Go down with me through the smoky,
reeking, filthy rancheries and note carefully the attitude and occupation
of these savages, and contrast your observation with that so
vividly recorded of them by Cook, Vancouver, Portlock, and Dixon,
and many other early travellers, and tell me in what manner have
they advanced one step higher than when first seen by white men
full a hundred years ago. You cannot escape the conclusion with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
this tangible evidence in your grasp, that in attempting to civilize
the Alaskan Indian the result is much more like extermination, or
lingering, deeper degradation to him than that which you so earnestly
desire. The cause of this failure of the missionary and the
priest is easy to analyze: it is due to the demoralizing precept and
example of those depraved whites who always appear on the field
of the Indian mission, sooner or later; if they could be shut out,
and the savage wholly uninfluenced by their vicious lives, then the
story of Alaskan Indian salvage might be very different. Still, the
thought will always come unbidden and promptly—these savages
were created for the wild surrounding of their existence; expressly
for it, and they live happily in it: change this order of their life,
and at once they disappear, as do the indigenous herbs and game
before the cultivation of the soil and the domestication of animals.</p>

<p>The Indians of Alaska, however, will never call upon the Government
for food and reservations—there is a great abundance on
the earth and in the waters thereof for them; living as they do all
down at tide-water, at the sole source of their subsistence, they are
within the quick reach of a gunboat; the overpowering significance
of that they fully understand and fear. There is a huge wilderness
here for them which the white man is not at all likely to occupy,
even in part, for generations of his kind to come, yet unborn.</p>

<p>Sitka is the seat of that Alaskan civil government<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> which Congress,
after much deliberation, ordered in 1884; but the governor
lives here in much humbler circumstances than did his Slavonian
predecessors. As it would require a small fortune to rehabilitate the
“castle,” the present chief-magistrate resides in one of those neatly
built houses which the military authorities erected shortly after they
took charge in 1867-68; it is not at all commanding, but has a
pleasant vista from its windows over the parade ground, and the
steamers’ landing.</p>

<p>While the most impressive feature of the Sitkan archipelago is
unquestionably that of the awe-inspiring solemnity and grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
beauty of its strange wilderness, yet the most interesting single
idea is the Indian and the life he leads therein; with the single exception
of the substitution of a woollen blanket and a cotton shirt
for his primitive skin garments, he is living here to-day just as he
has lived away back to the time when his legends fail to recite, and
centuries before the bold voyages of Cook and Vancouver, and the
savage sea-otter fleet of Baranov, first discovered him and then
made his existence known to the civilized world. True, some of
the young fellows who have labored upon vessels and in the fish-canneries
wear an every-day workingman’s shirt and trousers, and
speak a few words of English, understanding much more, yet the
primeval simplicity of all Indian life in this district is substantially
preserved.</p>

<p>These savages are fish-eaters, and as such they have a common
bond of abrupt contrast in physique with their meat-eating brethren
of the Rocky Mountains and the great plains; but the traits
of natural disposition are the same, the heart and impulse of the
Haidah or the Tongass, are the heart and the impulse of the Sioux
or the Cheyenne—the former moves nowhere except squatted in
his shapely canoe, the other always bestrides a pony or mustang.
This wide divergence in every-day action gives alone to these savages
their strongly marked bodily separation; the fish-eater is stooping
as he stands, and though he has a deep chest and sinewy arms, yet
his lower limbs are bowed, sprung at the knees, and imperfectly
muscled; while the meat-eater is erect and symmetrical, in fine
physical outline from the crown of his head to his heels.</p>

<p>The various divisions or bands of the Indian population of the
Sitkan archipelago and mainland<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> differ but little in their manner
of life and customs, and speak closely related dialects of the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
language. The Haidahs are the best dispositioned and behaved.
They have been from the earliest times constantly in the habit of
making long and incessant canoe voyages; and, taking into account
the ease with which all parts of this region can be reached on water,
it is rather surprising that any marked difference in language should
be found at all; still, when we recall the knowledge which we have
of their fierce inter-tribal wars, it is not so strange; this warfare,
however, was of the same barbarous character as that recognized in
all other American savages—it was the surprise and massacre of
helpless parties, never sparing old women, children or decrepit men.
These internecine family wars have undoubtedly been the sole cause
of the present subdivisions of the savages as we note them to-day.</p>

<p>In drawing the picture, faithfully, of any one Alaskan Indian, I
may say candidly that in so doing I give a truthfully defined image
of them all throughout the archipelago. Physically the several
tribes of this region differ to some extent, but not near so much as
our colored people do among themselves; the margin of distinction
up here between the ten or eleven clans, which ethnologists enumerate,
is so slight that only a practised eye can declare them. The
Haidahs possess the fairest skins, the best temper, and the best
physique; while the ugly Sitkans and Khootznahoos are the darkest
and the worst. But the coarse mouth, the width and prominence
of the cheek bones, and the relatively large size of the head for the
body, are the salient main departures from our ideal symmetry.</p>

<p>The body is also long and large, compared with the legs,
brought about by centuries of constant occupation in canoes and
the consequent infrequent land travel; their hair is black and
coarse, unkempt, and never allowed, by the males, to fall below
their shoulders except in the case of their “shamans,” or doctors.
A scattered, straggling mustache and beard is sometimes allowed
to grow upon the upper lip and chin, generally in the case of the
old men only, who finally grow weary of plucking it out by the
roots, which in youth they always did in sheer vanity.</p>

<p>Once in a while a face is turned upon you from a canoe, or in a
rancherie, which arrests your attention, and commands comment
as good-looking; these instances are, however, rare—very, very
rare. I think the Haidahs give more evidence in average physiognomy
of possessing greater intelligence than that presented in the
countenances of their brethren; while I deem the Sitkas and
Khootznahoos to be the most insensible—if they are as bright they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
conceal the fact with astonishing success. Again, the ferocity and
exceptionally savage expression of their faces, which Captain Cook
and Vancouver saw and so graphically recorded, has faded out completely;
but in all other respects they agree to-day perfectly with
those descriptions of these early voyagers. In those days firearms
had not destroyed their faith in elaborate armaments of spear and
bow and body armor-shields of wood and leather, so that they then
appeared in much more elaborate costumes and varied pigments
than they do now.</p>

<p>Each tribe has one or more large “rancheries,” or villages, in
which it lives, and which are always located at the level of the sea,
just above tide and surf, at river-mouths, or on sheltered bays of
the islands, or the mainland; these rancheries, or houses, are built
of solid, heavy timbers in the permanent villages, or thrown loosely
together of lighter material in their temporary or camping stations.
The general type of construction is the same throughout the archipelago,
the most substantial houses being those of the Haidahs,
who give more care to the accurate fitting together and ornamentation
of their edifices than is shown elsewhere. They certainly
show a greater constructive facility and mechanical dexterity, not
only in the better style of house-building but in the greater number
of, greater size of, and excessively elaborate carved totem posts.
These peculiar adjuncts to Alaskan Indian architecture are small
and shabby everywhere else when compared with the Prince of
Wales exhibition.</p>

<p>All permanent villages are generally situated with regard to one
great idea—easy access to halibut-fishing banks and such coast fisheries,
which occupy the greater proportion of the natives’ time in
going to and coming from them when not actually engaged in fishing
upon these chosen grounds; therefore it happens that, occasionally,
a village will be located on a rocky coast, bleak and exposed, though
carefully placed at the same time so as to permit of the safe landing
of canoes in rough water. These houses always face seaward, and
stand upon some flat of soil, elevated a few feet above the high-tide
mark, where below there is usually a sandy or gravelly beach upon
which the fleet of canoes is drawn out, or launched from, as the
owners come and go at all hours of the day and night. The houses
are arranged side by side, either in close contact, or else a space of
greater or less width between. A promenade or track is always left
between the fronts of the houses and the edge of the bank, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
ten to thirty feet in width; it constitutes a street, and in which
the carved posts and temporary fish-drying frames, etc., are usually
planted. Also those canoes that are not in daily use, or will not
be used for some time, are invariably hauled up on this street, and
carefully covered by rush-mats or spruce-boughs, so as to protect
them from the weather, by which they might be warped or cracked.</p>

<p>The rancheries are themselves never painted by their rude architects
and builders; they, however, soon assume a uniform, inconspicuous,
gray color, and become yellowish-green in spots, or overgrown
with moss and weeds owing to the dampness of the climate.
If it were not for the cloud of bluish smoke that hovers over these
villages in calm weather, they would never be noticed from any considerable
distance.</p>

</figure>

<p>In localities where the encroachment of mountain and water
make the village area very scant, two rows of houses are occasionally
formed, but in no instance whatever is any evidence given in
these Koloshian settlements of special arrangement of dwellings,
or of any set position for the house of the chief man of the village:
he may live either in the centre or at the extreme end of the row.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Each house usually shelters several families, in one sense of the
term; these are related to each other and under the tacitly acknowledged
control of some elder, to whom the building is reputed
to belong, and who is a person of greater or less importance in the
tribe or village according to the amount of his property or cunning
of his intellect.</p>

<p>Before some of these Siwash mansions a rude porch or platform
is erected, upon which, in fair weather, a miscellaneous group of
natives will squat in assembly, conversing, if squaws, or gambling, if
men. The houses themselves are usually square upon their foundations,
and vary much in size, some of them being a hundred feet
square, while most of them are between fifty and sixty feet, the
smaller rancheries being less than twenty. The gable end, and the
entrance right under its plumb, always faces the street and beach-view;
the roof slopes down at a low pitch or angle on each side,
with a projecting shelter erected right over the hole left in the roof-centre,
intended for the escape of smoke—no chimneys were ever
built. This shelter, or shutter, is movable, and is shifted by the
Indian just as the wind and rain may drive; the floor is oblong or
nearly square, and, in the older and better constructed examples, is
partly sunk in the earth, <em>i.e.</em>, the ground has been excavated to a
depth of six or eight feet in a square area, directly in the centre,
with one or two large earthen steps or terraces left running around
the sides of the cellar. A small square of bare dirt is left in the
exact centre, again, of this hole, while the rest of the floor is covered
with split planks of cedar; the earthen steps which environ
the lower floor are in turn faced and covered with cedar-slabs, and
these serve not only for sleeping and lounging places, but also for
the stowage, in part, of all sorts of boxes and packages of property
and food belonging to the family; the balance of these treasures
usually hangs suspended, in all manner of ingenious contrivances,
from the heavy beams and roof-poles overhead. The rancheries
which are built to-day by Alaskan Indians nearly all stand on the
surface of the ground without any excavation—a decided degeneracy.</p>

<p>The pattern of the Koloshian house is maintained with little
variation throughout the archipelago, and has been handed down
from remote antiquity. When, after extended confabulation, a
number of Indians agree to build a house, several months are
passed first in the forest by them, where they are engaged in felling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
the trees and dressing the timbers necessary; when these logs
and planks are finally hewn into shape (everything in this line is
done with axes and the little adze-like hatchets so often described),
they are tumbled into the water and towed around to the contemplated
site of the new edifice. The great size of the beams and
planks used in a big Indian rancherie make it imperative that a
large number of hands co-operate in the work. The erection,
therefore, of such a structure in all its stages, the cutting and hewing
in the woods, the launching and towing of the timbers to the
foundations, and their subsequent elevation and fitting, forms the
occasion of a regular gathering, or “bee,” that generally calls in
whole detachments from neighboring villages, which is always the
precursor to a grand “potlatch,” or giving away of the portable
property of the savage for whom the labor is undertaken.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p0480_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">Section Showing Arrangement of Interior of a Rancherie.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some of the larger houses have required the repeated assembling
of a whole tribe, and the lapse of two or three years of time
ere completion in all details, because the Siwash for whom the work
has been done has regularly exhausted his available resources on
each occasion, and has needed this interval, longer or shorter as it
may have been, in which to accumulate a fresh stock of suitable
property, especially blankets, with which to reward a renewed and
continued effort. Dancing and gambling relieve the monotony of
the labor, which, however, seldom ever is suffered to occupy more
than two or three hours of each day, and is conducted in a perfect
babel of guttural talk and noise, and the exultant shouting of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
entire combination of men, women, and children, as the great
beams are placed in position.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In the construction of these dwellings the savage uses no iron
or wooden spikes, he “mortices” and “tenons” rudely but solidly
everything that requires binding firmly; in the lighter and temporary
summer rancheries much use is made of cedar-root and bark-rope
lashings to the same end. Within the last fifteen or twenty
years the common use of small windows has been employed, the
glazed sashes being purchased from the whites either at Victoria or
else brought up to order by the traders; these are inserted in the
most irregular manner, usually on the sides under the eaves.</p>

<p>The oddly-carved totem posts, which appear in every village,
sometimes like a forest of dead trees at distant sight, are, broadly
speaking, divisible into two classes: that is to say, the clan or
family pillars, and those erected as memorials of the dead. There
has been too much written in regard to these grotesque features
seeking to endow them with idolatry, superstitions, and other
fancies of the savage mind. Nothing of the kind, in my opinion,
belongs to the subject; the image posts of the totem order are
generally from 30 to 50 feet in height, with a diameter of 3 to 5
feet at the base, tapering slightly upward. They are often hollowed
at the back, after the fashion of a trough, so that they can be
the easier handled and put into position. Those grotesque figures
which cover these posts from top to bottom, closely grouped together,
have little or no serious significance whatever: they always
display the totem of the owner, and a very marked similarity runs
through the carvings of this character in each village, though they
have a wide range of variation when one settlement is contrasted
with another. I am unable to give any definite explanation, that is
worthy of attention, of the real meaning of all those strange designs—perhaps,
in truth, there is none; they are simply ornamental
doorways.</p>

<p>The smaller memorial posts are also generally standing in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
village, upon the narrow border of land running between the houses
and the beach, but in no determinate relation to the buildings.
When a man falls before prostrating illness, his relatives call in the
medicine man, or “shaman,” and also invite the friends of the family
to the house of sickness, usually providing them with tobacco;
soon the rancherie is full of curious friends, of smoke, and of the
abominable noise of the shaman. If the patient dies, the body is
not burned now, as it used to be prior to the advent of the whites,
but is bent double into a sitting posture, and enclosed in a square
cedar box, which has been made for this purpose by the joint labor
of the assembled Indians, or else they have subscribed and purchased
it from some one of their number. This coffin is exactly
the same in shape and size as the box commonly used by every
Siwash family here for the reception of spare food, oil, etc., so that
there never is any delay or difficulty in getting one.</p>

<p>If the dead Koloshian is a man of only ordinary calibre, his
body is put, while still warm, into the wooden crib, and this is at
once carried out and stored away in a little tomb-house, which is
generally a small covered shed right behind the rancherie, or in the
immediate vicinity. This vault is also made by the united labor of
the men of the village, and paid for in the same manner as that indicated
for the purchase of the coffin-box. In it may be placed but
a single body, then again it will contain several—all relatives, however.
But should the deceased savage have been one of great importance,
then the whole rancherie itself is given up to the reception
of the body, which is boxed and placed therein, sitting thus, in state,
perhaps for a year or more, no one removing any of the things, the
members of the family all vacating the premises, and seeking quarters
elsewhere in the village. Now it becomes necessary, sooner or
later, to erect a carved post to the memory of this man. Again the
Indians collect for the purpose, and are repaid by a distribution of
property made by the deceased man’s brother, or that relative to
whom the estate has come down, in order of descent. This
inheriting relative takes possession the moment the body of the
dead has been enclosed in its cedar casket, and not before.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The doorway to the Alaskan house is usually a circular hole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
through which the Indian must stoop to half his stature when he
enters. It is generally from four to six feet from the ground, and
is gained by a rude flight of stairs or a notched log leading up to
it on the outside, and in the same manner down to the floor on the
inside. As you enter, the whole interior seems dark—everything,
at first, indistinct, and the only light being directly above and
below the smoke-hole in the roof, for a blanket is dropped as a
portière over the doorway the moment you pass within. In the
centre of this gloomy interior, directly beneath a hole in the roof,
is the fireplace, upon which logs are smouldering or fitfully blazing;
kettles of stewing fish, and oil and berries simmering under the
care of some squatty, grimy squaws who surround it. If this house
be a large one you will find within fifty or sixty Koloshes of both
sexes, all ages, and in all conceivable attitudes, as they stand, sit,
or lounge or sleep around the four sides of the deep terraced room,
some cleaning firearms, others repairing fishing-tackle, or carving
in wood or slate; while others are idly staring into the fire, or,
wrapped in their blankets, are sleeping with reiterated snoring.
Against the walls, pendent from the black, sooty beams overhead,
hang an infinite variety of personal effects peculiar to this life, such
as fish-spears and hooks, canoe paddles, bundles of furs, cedar-bark
lines and ropes, immense wooden skewers of dried salmon and halibut,
while the boxes which contain the real wealth of such people—blankets,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
tobacco, and cloths of cotton, and handkerchiefs of silk,
are stowed away in the corners.</p>

<p>But odors that the civilized nose never before scented now rise
thick and fast as you contemplate this interior, and the essential oils
of rancid oolachan grease, decaying fish, and others, in rotation swift,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
of many shades of startling disgust, cause you to speedily turn and
gladly seek, with no delay, the outer stairway, even though a tempest
of rain and wind is beating down (with that fury which seems
to be most pronounced in violence here as compared with the rest
of the world, when it does storm in earnest). Here again it is not
pleasant for us to tarry even in fair weather, inasmuch as the Koloshian
has no idea of sewerage or of its need, the refuse—slops,
bones, shells, fish-débris, and a medley of similar and worse nuisances
are lazily thrown out of this doorway on either side and
straight ahead, as they are from the entrance to every other
rancherie in the village. A merciful growth of rank grass and
mighty weeds charitably covers and assimilates much, but yet the
atmosphere hangs heavy around our heads—we move away.</p>

<p>On ordinary occasions a head-covering is usually dispensed with,
unless it be some old hat of our style. The squaws, however, fashion
and often wear grass hats, made as they weave their fine basketware;
they have the form of an obtuse cone, generally ornamented
by conventional designs painted in black, blue, or red. The feet
are almost invariably bare—too wet for moccasins. Painting the
face is a very common practice; vermilion is the favorite pigment,
and is usually rubbed in without the least regard to pattern or
effect; blue and black colors also are used in the same manner, but
I have never seen their limbs or bodies so treated, which is the
common method of meat-eating savages, who always paint themselves
with great care as to exact and symmetrical design. Here
the faces of Alaskan Siwashes are thus daubed for the dance or for
mourning; especially hideous are the mixtures of spruce-gum
grease, and charcoal which you observe smeared over the countenances
of the Sitkans, who do so chiefly to prevent unpleasant effects
of the sun when it happens to shine out upon them as they are fishing
or paddling extended journeys in their canoes, and who also
give you an ugly reminder of their being in mourning by the same
application.</p>

<p>Bracelets are beaten-out pieces of copper or brass wire and
silver coins, highly polished, and worn chiefly by the women, who
often carry several upon each arm. When worn upon the ankles
they are forged in round sections, while for the wrist they are made
quite flat. Tattooing once was universal, but is now going out of
style; and, until quite lately, the females all wore labrets in the
lower lips—this disgusting distortion is also being abated. Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
among the very old women can this monstrosity now be found in its
original form. Most of the middle-aged squaws still have a small
aperture in the lower lip, through which a little silver, beaten tube,
of the size of a quill, is thrust, and projects from the face, just
above the chin, about a quarter of an inch. The younger women
have not even this remnant of a most atrocious old custom. The
ears are often pierced, and tiny shell ornaments, backed with thin
sheet-silver or copper, are inserted; and also the septum of the
nose is perforated, of both sexes very generally, for the insertion of
a silver ring, or a pendant of haliotis shell.</p>

<p>Each village has its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex non scripta</i>, and is a law unto itself everywhere
within the confines of the Alexander archipelago; or, in different
words, it conducts its affairs wholly without reference to any
other village or savages—it is the largest unit in the Indian system
of government. Living as they do in these settlements, where they
know each other just as well and as familiarly as we know the individual
members of our own private home circles, no matter whether
the village contain a thousand souls or but half a dozen—there are
no strangers in it. Every little daily incident of each other’s simple
life, every move that they make, what they capture in the forest
or hook out from the sea, is regularly recounted in the rancheries
over night. All engaged in precisely the same calling of
fishing and hunting, naturally there is no room among them for the
eager rivalries and passionate enterprises which our living stimulates
and sustains. Therefore the routine of government is almost
nothing in its detail—no laws appear to be necessary, and they are
not acknowledged; but any action tending to the injury of another,
in person or property, lays the offender open to reprisals by the sufferer—usually
atoned for—and the village feud, thus aroused, is
soon satisfied by a payment in blankets, or other valuable property,
to a full settlement. Injuries, thefts and murder, however, which,
inflicted by the people of one village upon another, either close at
hand or remote, have not always been adjusted in this amicable
manner; hence, from time immemorial, the disputants have been
at war with each other in this region, and the result of these wars
has been to divide them into the existing clans as we find them
now. Their internecine warfare was carried on in true savage style.
If the cause was one which concerned the whole village, then the
chief of that settlement could implicitly count upon the services of
every male Indian able to bear arms; and although these savages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
are fearless and brave, yet they know no open, fair fight—taught to
get his living by stratagem when fishing or hunting, so the Kolosh
advances in capturing his human enemies, just as all other Indians
have done and do.</p>

<p>Each village has a well-recognized head man, or chief, who, though
possessing much influence, still never has had, and does not now
enjoy, that absolute rule which is attributed to such Indians. He
is really a presiding elder over the several families in the hamlet,
and, without their consent, his decisions are futile or carry no
weight. He has no power to compel other members of the tribe
to work, hunt, or fish for him, and if he builds a house, or a canoe,
he has to hire them to labor by making the customary “potlatch,”
just as any other man of the tribe would do—only he must give a
little more. The social rules which exist among these savages show
many strange features, for though every rancherie has its freely-acknowledged
chief, yet they are divided into as many or more
families than there are houses, each one of which has its own regulations,
and a subordinate authority of its own governing it, and it
alone.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The Sitkan Indians trouble themselves very little about the interior
country; but the coast line, and especially the margins of
rivers and streams, are duly divided up among the different families.
These tracts are regarded as strictly private property, just as
we would regard them if fenced in as farms and cattle ranches—and
they are passed from one generation to the other in the line of
savage inheritance; they may be sold, or even rented by one family
desiring to fish, to gather berries, to cut timber, or to hunt on the
domain of another. So settled and so strict are these ideas of proprietary
and vested rights in the soil, that, on some parts of the
coast, corner-stones and stakes may be seen to-day set up there to
define the limits of such properties between savages, by savages;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and furthermore, woe to the disreputable trespassing Siwash who
steps over these boundaries and appropriates anything of value,
such, for instance, as a stranded whale, shark, seal, or otter—berries,
wreckage, or shell-fish.</p>

<p>The woods and the waters are teeming with animal life; the lofty
semi-naked peaks harbor mountain goats in large flocks; the beautiful
grouse of Sabine hides in the forest thickets; the land otter
and the mule-eared deer haunt the countless ravines, valleys, and
rivulet bottoms; salmon in fabulous numbers run up those streams,
and big, brown and glossy black bears come down to fatten upon
these spawning fish. But the Sitkan savage is indolent, and, though
all this dietary abundance and variety is before him, he lives quite
exclusively upon halibut and salmon, the former mostly fresh and
the latter air-dried and smoked in the soot of his rancherie. Halibut
he finds all the year round; salmon briefly run only at widely
separated periods.</p>

<p>The halibut fishery is the one systematic regular occupation of the
natives. These fish may be taken in all waters of the archipelago
at almost any season, though on certain banks, well known to the
Indians, they are more numerous at times. When the halibut are
most active and abundant, the Koloshians take them in large quantities,
fishing with a hook and line from their canoes, which are anchored
over the favored spots by stones attached to cedar-bark
ropes or cables. They still employ their own primitive, clumsy-looking
hook in decided preference to using our own make. When the
canoe is loaded to the gunwale by an alert fisherman, these halibut
are brought in to some convenient adjacent point on the shore,
where they are handed over to the women, who are there to take
care of them, usually living in a temporary rancherie. They squat
around the pile, rapidly clean the fish, removing the larger bones,
head, fins, and tail, and cut it into broad, thin flakes. These are
then hung on the poles of a wooden frame trellis, where, without
salt, and by the wind and sun alone, sometimes aided by a slow fire
underneath the suspended fish-meat, the flakes are sufficiently
cured and dried; then they are packed away in those characteristic
cedar boxes for future use.</p>

<p>A group of old and young squaws, half-nude, flecked with shining
scales and splashed with blood, as they always are when at work
upon a fine run of halibut or salmon—such a group is to be vividly
remembered ever afterward, if you see it even but once. The little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
pappooses, entirely naked, with big heads and bellies, slender
necks and legs, are running hither and thither in infantile glee and
sport, always with a mouthful of raw ova or a handful of stewed
fish from the kettle near by, while the babies, propped up in their
stiff-backed lashings, croon and sleep away the time.</p>

<p>There are no rivers of any size flowing on the islands of the Sitkan
archipelago; but there are rapid rivulets and broad brooks in
great numbers. Many of these are large enough to be known as
“salmon rivers.” The first run of those attractive fish usually takes
place up some of the longest island-streams and the mainland rivers
about July 10th to 20th. A month later a larger species begins to
arrive from the depths of the ocean outside, and this run sometimes
lasts, in a desultory manner, until January. These salmon, when
they first appear, are fat and in superb condition and color; but as
they leave the salt water and take up their persistent, tireless ascent
of fresh-water channels they become hook-jawed, lean, and pale-fleshed.
They ascend very small streams in especially great numbers
when these rivulets are swollen by the heavy rains of October,
and, being easily caught and very large, they constitute the chief
harvest of the Alaskan Indian—his meat and bread, in fact. They
are either speared in the shallow estuaries or trapped in brush and
split-stick weirs, which are planted in the streams. Everyone of
the little salmon brooks has its owner in the Indian law. They are
the private property of the several families or subdivisions of the
clans. Those people always come out of their permanent village
houses during the fishing period, and camp upon the banks of
their respective water claims.</p>

<p>It is quite unnecessary to itemize all the species of food-fishes
in the Alexander archipelago, for anything and everything that is
at all abundant in the vicinity of an Indian rancherie is sure to be
eaten; trout, herring, flounders, rock-cod, and the rosy, glittering
<em>sebastines</em> constitute minor details of the savage dietary. Codfish
are taken in these waters, but not in great numbers, nor are they
especially sought for. The spawn of the herring<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> is collected on
spruce boughs, which the Indians carefully place at low-water on
the spawning grounds; then, when taken up, it is smoke-dried and
stored away.</p>

<p>But the “loudest” feast of these savages consists of a box, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
opened, of semi-rotten salmon-roe. Many of the Siwashes have a
custom of collecting the ova, putting it into wooden boxes, and
then burying it below high-water mark on the earthen flats above.
When decomposition has taken place to a great extent, and the
mass has a most penetrating and far-reaching “funk,” then it is
ready to be eaten and made merry over. The box is usually uncovered
without removing it from its buried position; the eager
savages all squat around it, and eat the contents with every indication
on their hard faces of keen gastronomic delight—faugh!</p>

<p>The same ill-favored and heartily-hated “dog-fish”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> of our Cape
Cod fishermen is also very abundant in these far-away waters.
Recently, the demand created for its oil by the tanneries of Oregon
and California has made its capture by the Indians an important
source of revenue to them; the oil rendered from its liver is readily
sold by them to the white traders, who also have established a
fishery for the purpose on Prince of Wales Island. These traders
also are making good use of herring-oil, which is to be secured
here in unfailing, abundant supply, to any quantity required.</p>

<p>The most grateful condiment to the Sitkan palate is rancid fish-oil,
or oolachan “butter”—a semi-solid grease, with a fetid smell
and taste; into this they always dip or rub their flakes of dried fish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
their berries, in fact everything that they eat. A little wooden
trencher or tub, grotesquely carved, always is to be seen (and
smelled), placed alongside of the monotonous kettle of stewed fish, or
pile of dried fish, which constitutes the regular spread for a full meal.
And again, a very curious, soap-like use of this oil is made by the
younger and more comely savages. An Indian never washes in water
up in this wet and watery wilderness. I never have seen an attempt
made to wash the face or hands with water, but they do rub oil vigorously
over, and scrub it off bright and dry with a towel, or mop, of
cedar-bark shreds or dry sedge-grass. The constant presence of
this strong-flavored oil renders it a physical impossibility for a white
man, not long-accustomed to its odor, to enter a rancherie and eat
with the inmates, unless the pangs of starvation make him ravenous.</p>

<p>Whether from taste itself, or sheer indolence, the culinary art
of these people is confined to the incessant simmering and boiling
of everything which is not eaten raw, or ripe; copper, sheet-iron,
and brass kettles being now universally used, are the only decided
innovation made by contact with ourselves in their aboriginal
cooking outfit, though the introduction of tin and cheap earthenware
dishes is growing more general every day. Most of the Indian
household utensils are made of wood; they are fashioned in
several forms or types, which appear to have been faithfully copied
from early time. The berry and the food-trays are cut out of solid
pieces of wood, the length being about one and one-third times as
great as the width, while the depth is relatively small. In some of
the large rancheries these trays, or troughs, are six to ten feet long;
the outer ends of those receptacles are generally carved richly in all
sorts of fancy relief; and, sometimes, the sides are grotesquely
painted. A common form, and smaller in size, and a great favorite
with the family, is boat-shaped, the hollow of the dish being oval;
the ends are provided with odd prow-shaped projections that serve
as handles—one of these ends being usually carved into the head
and fore-feet of some animal or bird, the other to represent its
hind-feet and tail. These dishes are seldom more than eight or ten
inches in length, and curve upward from the middle each way, like
the “sheer,” or the gunwale, of a clipper ship.</p>

</figure>

<p>Water-dippers, pot-spoons and ladles are made from horns
of the mountain sheep. They are steamed, bent, and pared down
thin, carved and shaped so as to be exceedingly symmetrical, and
well finished. The stew and berry-spoons in ordinary use are made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>from the stiff, short black horns of the mountain goat, the handles
often carved to represent a human form, animal, or bird. Knives
of all sorts are now in use. Much ingenuity is often exhibited by
the adaptation of old blades to new handles—in converting the
large, flat blacksmithing files into keen weapons, and making fish-cleaning
knives out of pieces of iron; thin, square or oblong sheets
of this metal are so fitted into oblong wooden handles as to resemble
the small hash-knives used in our kitchens.</p>

<p>But the Sitkan housekeeper glories in her boxes—great chests
and little ones—in which she stores everything of value belonging to
the family, except the dogs and the canoes. The big boxes, corded
up with bark ropes, are her blanket and fur treasuries; the smaller
ones contain her oolachan “butter” and dried fish and meat. The
larger chests are from two and a half to four feet square; the lesser
are between a foot to two feet. The sides of such a box are made
of a single piece of thinly shaven cedar board, which by steaming
is bent three times at a right angle, and pegged tightly and very
neatly up to the fourth corner. The bottom is a separate solid
plank, keyed in with little pegs very solidly, and water-tight; the
cover is cut out of a thick slab, and fits over and sets down heavily
on the upper edge of the chest. Those boxes are all decorated in
designs of the peculiar type so common among these savages,
painted in black and white. The next desideratum of the squaw is
a full supply of cedar-bark mats, which she plaits from strips of
this material, and which are always spread out on the ground or
rude plank floor when the Indian prepares to roll up in his blanket
for slumber. Such mats are the pride of all Thlinket squaws, and
vary much in texture and in pattern.</p>

<p>But the daily routine of the dusky housekeeper is a very different
one indeed from that characteristic of woman’s labor in caring
for our homes. No sweeping or dusting in the Indian rancherie;
no bed-chambers to change the linen in and tidy up; no
kitchen or servants to look after; nothing whatever of the kind. Yet
the Indian matron is always busy. She has to hew the firewood
and drag it in; she has to carry water and attend to all of the rude
cooking and filling of the trenchers; she looks after the mats and
the sewing of the children’s fur and other garments—not much to
be sure in the way of dressmaking—she has to make all of the tedious
berry-trips, picking and drying of the fruit, as well as attending
to the preservation, in the same manner, of the fish and game which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
the man brings in. She has an infinite amount of drudgery to do
in the line of gathering certain herbs, bark, and shell-fish. Many
small roots indigenous to the country, containing more or less
starch, are eagerly sought after, dried, and stored away by the
women. The inner sap-layer of the spruce and also that of the
hemlock—the cambium layer—is collected by cutting the trees
down and then barking the trunks for that object. It is shaved off
in ribbons and eaten in great quantities, both fresh and dried, and
is considered very wholesome. It is sweet, mucilaginous, but distinctly
resinous in flavor. The rank-growing seeds, shoots, and
leaf-stalks of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epilobium heracleum</i>, and many others, are
plucked and carried by the squaws in huge bundles to the family
fire, and there eaten by all hands, the stalks being dipped, mouthful
after mouthful, in oil.</p>

<p>She has, however, no washing whatever of clothes to do for anybody,
except what little she may see fit to do for herself; she never
treats the dishes even to that ordeal. With all this, however, it
seems rather strange that the clothes of the Indians, consisting of
dresses, shirts and blankets for the men; and for women, petticoats,
chemises, dresses (sometimes), and blankets also—that these articles
usually appear neat and tolerably clean—the children excepted, as
they are always dirty beyond all adequate description. Every individual
attends to his or her own washing—if the husband wants a
clean shirt, he washes it himself.</p>

<p>Before the introduction of the potato through early white fur-traders,
the only plant cultivated by the Alaskan savages was a potent
weed which they grew as a substitute for tobacco—the importation
of the latter, however, has taken its place entirely to-day, because
the Virginian weed is far more pleasant. But the old stone
mortars and pestles that are still to be found knocking around
the most venerable town-sites, bear evidence to the industry of
making native tobacco here ages ago. This plant was prepared
for use by drying over a fire on a little frame stretcher, then bruised
to a powder in the stone mortars, then moistened and pressed into
cakes. It was not smoked in a pipe, but, mixed with a little clamshell
lime (burnt for the purpose), it was chewed or held in the
cheek, just as the Peruvian Indians use coca.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Everybody knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
how fond Indians are of tobacco—there is no exception to the rule
in Alaska, and no excuse for attempting to recite in these pages the
well-worn story anew.</p>

<p>No domesticated animals, except dogs, are to be found with the
Alaskan Indians—no cats or fowls. The original breed of curs has
been very much disguised by imported strains; the present natives
are gray and black, shaggy, wolfish beasts, about the size of a large
spitz dog. These cowardly, treacherous animals alone make a white
man’s stay in an Indian village a burden to his existence.</p>

<p>The work bestowed by several of the Sitkan clans upon their so-called
potato gardens is hardly to be designated as the “cultivation”
of that tuber. It forms to-day, this vegetable does, a very
important part of the food-supply, and where a white man takes
hold of such a garden the result, in a small way, is very satisfactory;
but the Siwash finds that the greater part of the low, flat,
rich soil in this country is so thickly wooded that the task of clearing
the ground is altogether too much for him to even consider,
much less undertake. But when he can find a place where an old
settlement once existed, though long abandoned—there the sites
of decayed rancheries are sure to be of rich, warm soil—such are
the spots which the Siwash calls his garden, and where his potatoes
are rudely planted, little or no attention being paid to the hoeing
and drilling which we deem essential, therefore the variety in use
has been run down so that the size and yield is very small, and the
quality watery and poor.</p>

<p>While we observe the very general possession of firearms in
every rancherie, and we hardly ever see a canoe-load of savages
unless the barrels of several muskets or rifles project over the
gunwale, yet these Sitkan Indians are not great hunters; but the
potent fact that there is no place in all this region where foot travel
is practicable into the interior, or even along the coast margin itself,
affords an excellent reason; they do, however, kill a very considerable
number of black bears every year, at two special seasons
therein, <em>i.e.</em>, when these brutes are found prowling upon the sea-beach.
But they never follow bruin into the mountainous recesses,
where he invariably retreats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>In the early spring, during that brief period when the weeds
and grasses first grow green along the outskirts of the timber in
warm sheltered nooks down by the tide-level, black bears come
below from the cold, gloomy cañons above and feed upon the
sprouting skunk-cabbage<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and other succulent shoots, browsing
here and rooting up there, these tender growths, just as hogs do
in our orchards and clover-fields. Again, late in autumn, when the
salmon rush up into the estuaries and through the shallows by
countless myriads, bruin is once more tempted down to the sea-beaches,
and again gets into trouble. In the same manner the
Indians secure the beautiful little mule-deer,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> which also loves
tender vegetation, and in this love falls an easy prey to the silent
approach of a canoe with its skulking crew. Geese and ducks, during
winter months, spend much time on the quiet fiörds in large
flocks, and constitute the chief gunning of the Siwashes, who shoot
them from their canoes with the same old flint-lock trade-muskets
first used by the whites a hundred years ago. The Indian admires
this pattern still above all other patterns—despises the percussion-cap,
which in this damp region often fails him, and the trader,
knowing this weakness of the savage, always has a stock of these
flint-lock muskets, newly made, on hand. A supply is steadily
furnished by the Hudson’s Bay Company at Victoria.</p>

<p>But the one thing of joy, of delight, and of infinite use to the
native of the Sitkan archipelago is his canoe. Life, indeed, would
be a sad problem for him were it not for this adjunct of his own
creation. Upon its construction he lavishes the best of his thought,
the height of his manual skill, and his infinite patience. The result
of this attention is to fashion from a single cedar log a little
vessel which challenges our admiration invariably, for its fine outline
and its seaworthiness and strength.</p>

<p>All the canoes of this region have a common model, and are similar
in type, though they differ much in details of shape and size.
They are all made from the indigenous pine<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and giant cedar,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> the
wood of which is light, durable, and worked very readily; but it is
apt to split parallel to its grain. This constitutes the only solicitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
of the Indian’s mind. He keeps the canoe covered with mats
and brush whenever it is hauled out, even for a few days, to avoid
this danger, for whenever a canoe is heavily laden, and working, as
it will do, in a rough channel, it is in constant danger of splitting
at the cleavage lines of its grain, and thus jeopardizing its living as
well as dead freight.</p>

<p>With an exception of the bow and stern-pieces, each canoe, no
matter how large or how small, is made in the same manner and
from a single log, which is roughed out in the forest, then towed
around to the permanent village, where it is hauled up in front of
the architect’s house. Here he works upon it during winter months,
usually in odd hours, employing nothing but his little adze-like hatchet
and fire to assist in giving it shape and fine lines. The requisite
expansion amidships, to afford that beam required, is effected
by steaming with water and hot stones and the insertion of several
thwart sticks. Canoes are smoothed outside and painted black, with
a red or white streak under the gunwale in most cases; inside
they bear the regular fine tooth-marks of the excavating adze, and
are smeared with red-ochre. The paddles are usually made of yellow
cypress, and a great variety of small wooden baling dippers are
also provided, one or two for each canoe, because the water often
slops over the gunwales in bad weather. The canoe itself is never
suffered to leak. The average size is one of fifteen to twenty feet
in length, which will carry from eight to ten savages, with baggage.
One having a length of from thirty to thirty-five feet carries as
many men. The smaller canoes of from twelve to thirteen feet are
usually used by one or two savages in their quick, irregular trips to
and from the village, and are easily launched and hauled out by one
man.</p>

<p>It is very doubtful, indeed, whether the Sitkan ever took or takes
any real enjoyment in hunting or fishing. If he does, it is never
exhibited on his countenance or evidenced by his language. It is,
in fact, the serious business of his life, and the steady routine of
its prosecution has robbed him of every enjoyable sporting sensation
which we love to experience when after fish or game. Perhaps,
however, he may recall the thrill of that feeling which he felt
when, as a boy, he was first taken out in his father’s canoe to the
halibut banks, and there permitted to bait a huge wooden hook
and haul away upon the taut kelp-line when the “kambala” had
swallowed it; but the necessity of going out to this shoal in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
sorts of disagreeable weather every summer and winter of his subsequent
existence, at very frequent intervals, soon destroyed pleasurable
emotions. Therefore, he fashions his acute-angled wooden
hooks, his iron-tipped fish and seal spears, and polishes up his musket
with none of those enjoyable anticipations which possess the
soul of a white sportsman.</p>

<p>In 1841-42 the best understanding of the Russian and English
traders agreed in reporting a population of over twenty thousand
Indians within the limits of the Alexander archipelago; to-day the
same country can show no more than a scant seven thousand. The
inroads that small-pox and measles have made, by which these
savages were destroyed even as fire sweeps through and burns
drought-withered thickets, leave little doubt as to the great numerical
superiority of earlier days as compared with the present. This
decay and abandonment is everywhere exhibited now even in the permanent
villages, where houses have been deserted completely: some
are shut up, mouldering, and rotting away upon their foundations;
others, large and fit for the shelter of fifty or sixty natives, will be
found tenanted by only two or three Siwashes. All the standing
carved posts in this entire region, with rare exceptions, are, as a rule,
more or less advanced into decay. A rank growth of weeds, dark and
undisturbed in some cases, presses up close to inhabited houses,
the traffic not being sufficient to keep them down. The original
features of these settlements, in a few years more of this unchecked
neglect and decay, will have entirely disappeared as they have
already at Sitka. At the present hour, however, we can go among
them, and readily call up to our minds what they once were when
they were swarming with occupants who were dressed in tanned-leather
shirts and sea-otter cloaks, as they thronged about the
ships of Cook and Vancouver.</p>

<p>Slavery, which was originally firmly interwoven with the social
fabric of these people, has been about abolished—slaves themselves
to-day are very scarce, and are not much more so than in name.
They were the captives taken in savage warfare between opposing
clans, and were most horribly tortured and cruelly treated by their
masters.</p>

<p>As a rule the young people marry young, after the stolid fashion
of Indians. They approve of polygamy, but seldom do you find a
man with more than one squaw, simply because the women do not
contribute materially and primarily to the support of the family,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
and attend only to the accessory duties of it; thus it becomes an
increased tax upon the dull energies of the savage whenever
he adds an extra woman to his household. The squaws are all well
treated everywhere up here; they have just as much to say as their
lords and masters whenever the occasion of buying, selling, or hiring
arises; as to the children (we will not see many of them to-day),
they are always kindly cared for by both parents, and the
whole tribe is as indulgent, since they are constantly roaming about
the village, after the custom of youngsters universally.</p>

<p>A candid verdict will result, in view of the surroundings of the
Koloshian, that the only vice which can be legitimately charged up
against him, or his kind, is the sin of gambling. To this dissipation
the Alaskan savage is desperately prone; the monotonous chant
of the stick-shuffling players is ever on the air in the villages. These
worthies sit on the ground, in a circle usually, in the centre of which
a mat is spread; six or seven small wooden pins about as large as
the little finger of your hand, upon which various values are
marked or carved, are taken into the hands of the first gambler,
who thrusts them into a ball of soft teased cedar bark, or holds
them under his blanket, then shuffles them rapidly, meanwhile
shouting a deep guttural <em>hah-hah-ee-nah-hah!</em> the others watch
him with lynx-like eyes for a few moments, when one of the
players suddenly orders the shuffler to show his hands, in which the
sticks are firmly clinched, and at the same time endeavors to guess
the value of these sticks in either one hand or the other, which
have been held up—he pauses a moment, then makes his decision,
the clinched hand designated is opened, the little sticks fall to the
mat, and the caller wins or loses just as he happens to hit the value
expressed by the markings on these pins: if he guesses correctly
he wins everything in the pot or pool, and takes up the wooden
dice in turn, to shuffle, shout, and repeat for the rest of the circle.
This game is usually sustained night and day, until some one of
the party remains the winner of everything that the others started
in with.</p>

<p>That wretched debauchery which an introduction of rum into
the rancheries of these natives has caused, cannot be justly laid at
the Indian’s door; this intense morbid craving for liquor among
the Alaskan savages of this region is most likely due to the climate—it
is not near so strong in the appetite of the natives who live
east of the coast range. Although Congress has legislated, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
our officials have endeavored to carry out the prohibition statutes,
yet the matter thus far is wholly beyond control—the savage cannot
only smuggle successfully within these intricate watery channels,
but he now thoroughly understands the distillation of rum itself
from sugar and molasses.</p>

<p>There is something in this atmosphere which enables a white
man to drink a great deal more with impunity than he can in any
other section of the United States or Territories—the quantities
of strong tea, the nips of brandy, wine, and cordials which he will
swallow with perfect physical indifference, in the course of every
day of his life, at Sitka for instance, would drive him to delirium
in an exceedingly short time if repeated at San Francisco. Naturally
enough, we find that the same craving for stimulants is reflected
by Indian stomachs; and now that they have fully grasped the
understanding of how to successfully satisfy that aching, no valid
reason can be presented why the Thlinket will not continue to
gratify a burning desire in this fatal direction to the ultimate extinction
of his race. This fault of our civilization is far more potent
to effect his worldly degeneration, than any one or all of our combined
virtues are to regenerate his earthly existence.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> The blanket is now, however, the general recognized currency among
these people. It is the substitute among them of that unit of value, the
beaver skin, which has been for so long the currency of the great Hudson Bay
region. The blankets used in Alaskan trade are of all colors—green, blue,
yellow, red, and white—of the very best woollen texture, none others will do.
They are rated in value by the “points” or line-marks woven into the edge,
the best and largest being a “four-point,” the smallest and poorest being
“one-point.” The unit of value is a single “two and a half point” blanket,
worth a little over $1.50. Everything is referred to this unit, even a large four-point
blanket is said to be worth so many blankets. Traders not infrequently
buy in blankets, taking them, when in good order, from the Indians as
money, and selling them out again as trade demands.</p>

<p class="no-indent">A bronzed humming-bird<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> lies upon the author’s table, that once
hovered and darted over the waters of Sitka Sound. Its torn and
rudely stuffed skin was given to him at Fort Simpson with the remark
that it came from the hot springs just below New Archangel;
and that nowhere else in all of a vast wilderness, outside of the
immediate vicinity of these springs, ever did or could a humming-bird
be found. Should, therefore, a visitor to this Alaskan solitude
chance to travel within it during the months of April and May, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
he will but follow the path of that wee brave bird, he will be led
into a veritable green and fragrant oasis, encircled all round about
with savage icy mountains and snowy forests.</p>

<p>Twenty miles south of Sitka, on the same island, in a pretty
little bay sheltered by a score of tiny islets, there—from the sloping
face of a verdant bank, the finest hot springs known to Alaska
flow up and out to the sea. Fleecy clouds of steamy moisture rise
over all to betray from a distance this delightful retreat; the luxuriant
vegetation, the variety of shrubs in full blossom here, when
all botanical life about them is as dead as cold can make it, create
thereon a spot in the early spring where all the senses of a traveller
can rest with exquisite pleasure—the waters of the bay in front
are covered with geese and ducks, while the rugged mountains that
rise as a wall behind are teeming with deer and bear and grouse,
secluded in the jungle.</p>

<p>The Indians, from time immemorial, have resorted to these
hot waters of Baranov Island; four distinct and freely flowing
springs take their origin in those crevices and fissures of the feldspathic
granite foundation of the earth hereabouts; the temperature
of the largest spring, at its source, is 150° to 160° Fah.; the
waters are charged with sulphur to a very great extent. So jealous
were the savages of any attempt among themselves which might
savor of a monopoly of the use of these healing, beneficent warm
streams, that no one tribe ever dared to build a village upon the
site; but, by tacit consent, all were allowed to camp thereon. Some
Indians often came from a distance of three hundred miles away to
enjoy the sanitary result of bathing here, a few days or a few
weeks, as their troubles might warrant.</p>

<p>Naturally the Russians, burdened at Sitka with all diseases
which flesh is heir to, turned their attention very promptly to this
sanitarium; they erected a small hospital and two spacious bathhouses
over the springs, keeping everything in the strictest order
and cleanliness, without and within doors. A sad change confronts
us to-day—in so far as care of human hands; but the savage
Sitkan is here, exulting in his renewed supremacy.</p>

<p>The occurrence, however, of hot springs is quite frequent everywhere
in this archipelago; yet their extent and volume of outflow
is not so great as evidenced by those we have just noticed of
Baranov Island. Indians love to immerse their entire bodies in
pools and eddies of these hot rivulets, which are cooled sufficiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
by flowing a dozen or fifty yards from their origin over pebbly
bottoms; Siwashes will soak themselves in this manner for
hours at a time, with nothing but their heads visible. Though
the Koloshian, like all others of his kind, never verbally complains,
yet he is subject to acute rheumatism, to fevers, and to divers malignant
cutaneous diseases; these springs, wherever known to him,
are always well regarded as his happy relief and hope. Certain it
is that when you behold the parboiled skin of a native, after bathing
here, the fair almost white complexion really startles, for, prior to
the immersion, he was a coppery brown or black.</p>

<p>Midway between these thermal fountains and Sitka is the site
of an old Russian jail or prison; in a deep inlet, with no land
in sight, but lofty mountains rising abruptly from the water’s edge,
is the “Redoubt.” Here a small alpine lake empties itself in a
foaming cascade channel of a few yards in width, that quickly
plunges into a cañon, the perpendicular walls of which are a full
thousand feet in mural height. The Russians erected mills of
various kinds along the rapids to avail themselves of such abundant
water-power; the buildings stood upon a bare rocky portion of the
channel, and were kept in order by an old veteran in command;
a squad of soldiers aided him; the fish, dried and salted salmon,
which were required for the use of the company, were annually
caught here as they swarmed up the cascade from the sea, into
Gloobaukie Lake.</p>

<p>The great facility of travel afforded by these sheltered canals of
the Alexander archipelago, has enabled and facilitated a most
energetic and persistent search for gold and silver by our miners,
but the rugged features of the country and its dense timber and
jungle have rendered the progress of such investigation slow, and
one of great physical difficulty. In the sands of every stream flowing
between California and Cook’s Inlet the “color” of gold can be
found, but the paying quantities therein seldom warrant a mining
camp or settlement. To-day the only mining rendezvous which we
find in Alaska is a little village of rough cabins called “Juneau
City,” located on the north side of Gastineaux Channel, at a point
near the upper end of that passage; near by, and adjacent, is
established a large gold-quartz stamp-mill<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> on Douglas Island,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
where the mining experts feel justified in predicting a steady and
inexhaustible yield of paying ore—it is paying handsomely at
present.</p>

<p>This subject of what is, or what is not, a good mining region or
investment is one to which no rational man can well afford to commit
himself. Those who have had extended experience in these
matters know that it is a topic which baffles the best investigator,
and returns no safe answer to the most intelligent cross-examination.
The true advice which can be honestly given is that which
prompts every man interested to look and resolve wholly for himself,
for he, in fact, knows just as much as anybody else. At the
most, the finding of a rich or desirable lead of gold or silver in a
new country is an accident or sheer opportunity of chance. Whether
it will hold out, or end in a “pocket,” is also only to be determined
by working it for all it is worth. Once in a while a man makes a rich
find, and is rewarded; but an overwhelming majority of prospectors
are ever wandering in fruitless, restless, tireless search for those
golden ingots which are still hidden in the recesses of mountain
ledges, or buried in the alluvium of river bottoms. The miners in
Alaska embrace various nationalities—Australians and Canadians,
Cornishmen and Californians, Oregonians and British Columbians
predominate—but the number aggregated is not large.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>If gold or silver-quartz mines of free-milling ore (no matter how
low the grade) can be located anywhere on the shores of these
mountainous fiörds of the Alexander archipelago, their wealth will
be great, because the transportation to them and from them is practically
without cost. The expense of working such valuable quartz
mines up a hundred or more miles from the sea, will result in abandonment,
where reaching them involves frequent transfers of supplies,
and the working season is cut by the rigor of winter to less
than half or one-third of every year. The same mines, down within
the dockage of an ocean-steamer in the Sitkan district would be
a steady source of wealth and industry all the year round.</p>

<p>The coal which is found here is not satisfactory for steamers’
use—too heavily charged with sulphur. Copper ore is well-known,
but not worked in competition with the Lake Superior and Arizona
cheap outputs. At the present writing there are no active industries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
whatsoever in the Sitkan archipelago beyond the energetic
stamp-mill of the Treadwell Mine on Douglas Island, and the
limited placer diggings of Juneau City. Until a market is created
for its large natural resources of food-fishes, the little canneries
which our people have started here will not develop; nor will the
timber be of much commercial importance until the great reservoirs
of the lower coast are exhausted. Statisticians and political
economists can easily figure out the time when a population of
twenty-five or thirty millions of our own people will be living upon
the Pacific coast alone; then the real value of those latent resources<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
of the Sitkan watery wilderness must be patent to a most
indifferent calculator.</p>

<p>With this survey of the Alexander archipelago fixed on our
minds, we pass from it through the bold Cross Sound headlands
that loom above those storm-churned swells of an open ocean, which
break here in unceasing turmoil, and we sail out into an area
that charts tell us is the “Fairweather ground,” over which that
superb peak itself and sister, Crillon, stand like vast sentinel-towers,
rearing their immense bulk into many successive strata of
clouds, until the elevation of thirteen thousand and fourteen thousand
feet is reached, sheer and bold above the sea. This great expanse
of the Pacific Ocean between us and Kadiak Island, five
hundred and sixty miles to the west, and again down to Victoria,
nine hundred miles farther to the south, was the rendezvous of the
most successful and numerous whaling fleet that the history of the
business records. In these waters the large “right” whale did most
congregate, and the capture of it between 1846 and 1851 drew not
less than three and four hundred ships with their hardy crews to
this area backed by the Alaskan coast. They never landed, however,
unless shipwrecked, which was a rare occurrence, but cruised
“off and on” with the majestic head of Mount Fairweather as their
point of arrival and departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>When the whalemen saw the summit of that snow-clad peak unveiled
by clouds they were sure of fair weather for several consecutive
days afterward, hence the name. Early one June morning
Captain Baker, of the <em>Reliance</em>, called the author up to see a mountain
which was sharply defined in the warm, hazy glow of the dawning
sunrise on the horizon—there, bearing N.N.E.,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> was the image
of Mount Fairweather, just as clear cut as a cameo, and lofty as
the ship’s spars, though one hundred and thirty-five miles distant!
Closely associated and fully as impressive and quite as high, was
the heavier form of the snowy Crillon.</p>

<p>That long stretch of more than four hundred miles of bare Alaskan
coast, between Prince William’s Sound and Cape Spencer, which
stands at the northern entrance to the Sitkan waters, is one that
sustains very little human or animal life, and is so rough and is so
bleak, that from September until May it is feared and avoided by
the hardiest navigator. The flanks of Mounts Fairweather and Crillon
rise boldly from the ocean at their western feet, and this sheerness
of elevation undoubtedly gives them that effect of cloud-compelling,
which does not lose its awe-inspiring power even when
a hundred miles away. To the northward and westward of Fairweather,
however, the alpine range which it dominates abruptly
sets back from the coast some forty or fifty miles, then turns about
and faces the sea in an irregular, lofty half-moon of more than three
hundred miles in length. A low table-land, or rolling shelf, is extended
at its base, intervening between the mountains and the wash
of the Pacific. It is timbered with spruce quite thickly, and reported
by the Indians to be the best berrying ground in all Alaska.</p>

<p>The Fairweather shore is a steep, woody one, much indented
with roadstead coves or bays; the coast line is hilly and uneven,
with some rocks and rocky islets scattered along not far out from
the surf. The sand-beaches which extend from Fairweather toward
the feet of those under St. Elias are remarkably broad and extensive;
so much so that, from the ship’s mast-head, large lagoons
within the outer swell of the open ocean are frequently seen.
These beach-locked estuaries communicate with the ocean by shallow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>breaks in the outer beach-wall of sand and gravel, across all of
which the sea rolls with great violence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="fs90">Under the shadow of this great mountain. Bering’s crew landed in July, 1741; they were the first white men to behold its sullen grandeur, and it
fitly stands as the initial point of that early recognition of Russian America. In clear weather it is distinctly seen by mariners, 150 miles at sea;
usually, however, it is wrapped in clouds</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Right under the towering slopes of Fairweather, as at St Elias,
is a large area of upland entirely destitute of verdure of any kind,
except the brown and russet mosses and lichens; huge, rugged
masses of naked rocks are strewn about in every direction—an old
prehistoric lava-flood, perhaps.</p>

<p>The coast, from the head of Cross Sound to Fairweather, is not
sandy, but may be well described as the surf-beaten base of a frozen
range of magnificent Alpine peaks.</p>

<p>In the centre of the arc of this grand crescent-range is the
superb body and hoary crest of Mount St Elias, which is, save
Mount Wrangel, now known to be the loftiest peak on the North
American coast; the latter is slightly higher. Triangulated from a
base line in Yakootat, in 1874, by one<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of the most accomplished
mathematicians of the U. S. Coast Survey, the summit of that royal
mountain was determined to be more than nineteen thousand feet
above the level of the tide at the observer’s feet. It was under the
shadow of this “bolshoi sopka” that Bering first saw the Continent
of North America on the 18th of July, 1741, and undoubtedly he
discerned it from a long distance, ere his boat landed. Two days
before anchoring, he records the fact that “the country had terrible
high mountains, which were covered with snow.”</p>

<p>When he finally landed (it was St. Elias’ day), near a point that
he named as he named the lofty central peak, Cape St. Elias, he
found the temporary summer-houses of a band of natives; those
people themselves had fled in terror from an unwonted invasion,
but the Russians soon had reason to regret their subsequent better
understanding.</p>

<p>After the storm which parted Bering, early in June, from the
company of the second vessel of his expedition, he had hoped to
fall in with her ever afterward, and while eagerly scanning the
coast and horizon about him for some sign of his lost comrades, the
hand of fate caused him to turn to the northward, when, had his
helm been set south, he would have met the object of his search.
For the other vessel, the <em>St. Paul</em>, had proceeded on its solitary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
course, and anxiously sought the commander, until it, too, had
sighted this same coast, three days earlier than had its storm-separated
consort. Tschericov came to anchor off some distance
from “steep and rocky cliffs”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> in “lat. 56°,” July 15. Weary and
expectant, the captain sent his mate with the long-boat and a crew
of ten or twelve of his best men away to the shore for the purpose
of inquiry and for a fresh supply of water. The ship’s boat disappeared
behind the point sheltering a small wooded inlet; it and
its men were never seen again by their shipmates. Troubled in
mind, but thinking that the surf, perhaps, had stove the boat in
landing, the captain sent his boatswain in the dingy with five men
and two carpenters, all well armed, to furnish the necessary assistance.
The small boat disappeared also, and it, too, was never seen
again. At the same time a great smoke was constantly ascending
from the shore. Shortly afterward two huge canoes, filled with
painted, yelling savages, paddled out from the recesses of the bay,
and lying at some distance from the ship, all howled, in standing
chorus, “Agai—agai!” then, flourishing their rude arms, they
rapidly returned to the shore. Sorrowfully the disturbed and distressed
Tschericov turned his ship’s course about and hurried home,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
not knowing the fate of his men, unable to help them, and, to this
day, no authentic inkling of what became of these Slavonian seamen
has ever been produced. Unquestionably, they were tortured
and destroyed.</p>

<p>The rains caught in the ship’s sails filled the casks of the
<em>Saint Paul</em>, since Tschericov, deprived of his boats and thoroughly
alarmed, made no further attempts to land; but he had not the
faintest idea of the presence, at that moment, of his superior officer
in the same waters, and only a few leagues to the northward, who
also, like himself was eagerly looking for his storm-parted consort.
What a most remarkable voyage, this voyage of the discovery of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the Alaskan region—what a chapter of disappointment, of hardship,
and of death!</p>

<p>That bluffy sea-wall which forms a face to the low coast plateau
at the feet of the St Elias Alps is cut by no great river, nor
indented by any noteworthy gulf or inlet, except at Yakootat Bay.
Here a succession of precipitous glaciers sweep down from the lofty
cradles of their birth to the waters of the sea, making an icy cliff of
more than fifteen miles in breadth, where it breaks in constant reverberation
and repetition. At the mouth of Copper River all silt carried
down from old eroded glacial paths has been deposited for thousands
and thousands of years, until a big deltoid chart of sea-water
channels in muddy relief of bank and shoal has been formed, and
through which the flood of an ice-chilled river takes its rapid
course.</p>

<p>The gloomy, savage wildness of this region of supreme mountainous
elevation, with its vast gelid sheets and precipitous cañons,
its sombre forests and eternal snows, all as yet wholly unexplored,
and only faintly appreciated as we can from the remote distance
of shipboard observation—this region cannot remain much longer
untrodden by the geologist and the naturalist, while the artist must
accompany them if an adequate presentation is ever to be given of
its weird, titanic realities.</p>

<p>The Mount St Elias shore-line is made up of small projecting
points, awash. These alternate with low cliffy or else white sandy
beaches, which border a flat, rolling woodland country that extends
back from the sea ten to thirty miles, where it suddenly laps and
rises upon the lofty flanks of the Elias Alps. Into the ocean many
rocky shoals and long sandy bars stretch for miles, and streams of
white muddy glacial or snow waters rush into the surf at frequent
intervals—hundreds of them.</p>

<p>There are sand-beaches and silt-shoals which extend from
Cape Suckling, up seventy-five miles to Hinchinbrook Island, that
stands as a gate-post to the entrance of Prince William’s Sound:
here is a long sand-ridge which is more than sixty miles in length
and from three to seven miles broad, lying between the ocean and
the mainland, which in turn is composed of low wooded uplands
and of steep abrupt cliffs and hills that are quickly lost in the lofty
snowy range of the Choogatch Alps. Through a section of this
dreary sand-wall the impetuous flood of the Copper or Atna River
forces its way, carrying its heavy load of glacial mud and silt far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
into the ocean. How the winds do blow here! How the trader
dreads to tarry “off and on” this coast!</p>

<p>There are a few lonely places in this world, and the wastes of the
great Alaskan interior are the loneliest of them all. Those of Siberia
are traversed occasionally by wandering bands, but those of
Alaska, never. The severe exigencies of climate there are such as
to substantially eliminate savage life, and to rear an impregnable
barrier to that of civilization.</p>

<p>When Alaska was first transferred, an estimate of many thousands
of Indians inhabiting its vast interior was gravely made and
as gravely accepted by us; but a thorough investigation made by
our traders and officers of our Government during the last fifteen
years has exposed that error. Hundreds only live where thousands
were declared to exist. The Indians who live on the banks of the
Copper River are, perhaps, the most poverty-stricken of all their
kind in Alaska. Their shiftless spruce-bark rancheries and rude belongings
are certainly the most primitive of their race, and render
that weird Russian legend of the massacre of Seribniekov in 1848,
which declared them so numerous and savage, absolutely grotesque.
They are perfectly safe as they live in their wild habitat. The cupidity
of savage or civilized man never has and never will molest
them. But if half is true as to what they relate of huge glaciers
which empty into their river, then those that have been described
in Cross Sound have formidable rivals, which may yet prove to be
superiors, perhaps, although it seems incredible.</p>

</figure>

<p>The Suchnito or Copper River has long been a bugbear, for the
Russians<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> years ago have returned from several unsuccessful attempts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>to ascend it, and gave the excuse of being driven out of the
valley by savage and warlike natives. Recently it has been thoroughly
explored, and the “savages” are found to be less than two
hundred inoffensive natives, who constitute the whole population of
this mysterious Atna or Maidnevskie region. But navigating the
river is terrific labor, inasmuch as it is a continuous, swift rapid
throughout its entire course.</p>

<p>This river is a short, turbulent, brawling stream, less than two
hundred and fifty miles in length, but rising in the heart of a lofty
and mighty mass of volcanic mountains. It receives a score of imposing
glaciers, which almost rival those of Icy Bay in Cross Sound.
The silt that these gelid rivers pour into its channel has given it a
deltoid mouth of extended and most intricate area.</p>

<p>Triangulations made by an officer of the Army last year declare
that Mount Wrangel is the loftiest peak on the North American
continent. The feet of this magnificent volcanic dome are
washed by the forks of Copper River, which is eighteen thousand
six hundred and forty feet below the apex of its smoking cap.
Then the river at this point is more than two thousand feet above
sea-level, so the vast altitude of more than twenty thousand feet
for Mount Wrangel seems to be truthfully claimed.</p>

<p>The soil which borders the abrupt banks of the Copper River is
entirely composed of glacial silt and gravel. It is moist and boggy
in the driest seasons, covered with rank growing grasses and dense
thickets of poplars, birches, and willows, that line the margins of
the stream. The higher lands, as they rise from the narrow valley,
are in turn clothed with a dense growth of spruce-forest, which
gradually fades out into russet-colored areas of rock-sphagnum as
the altitude increases to that point where nothing but the cold and
frost-defying lichen can cling alive to the weather-splintered summits
of alpine heights above.</p>

<p>Fish (salmon) are the chief reliance of these natives of Copper
River; they depend almost wholly upon the annual running
of those creatures. The difficulty of hunting is so great that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
savage is content with shooting a few mountain sheep, a wandering
moose or two, and, perhaps, a stray bear in the course of the year.
Also, huckleberries and salmon berries are abundant on the sunshiny
slopes of the high glacial river-terraces during August and
September.</p>

<p>West of the Copper River mighty masses of the Choogatch
Mountains rise directly from the sea without any intervening lowland,
save at three tiny points upon which savage man has hastened
to fix his abode. Many crests to this range on the north side
of Prince William’s Sound must have a mean elevation of over ten
thousand feet, densely wooded with semper-virent coniferous forests
up to a height of one thousand feet above sea-level, and covered
with everlasting snowy blankets to within three or four thousand
feet of the ocean at their bases. The body of Prince William’s
Sound is so forbidding in its dark grandeur that even the stolid
Russians never tired of narrating its stirring impression upon their
senses. Although the interior of this gulf is completely land-locked,
being sheltered from the south by the islands of Noochek and Montague,
yet it is by no means a safe or pleasant sheet of water to
navigate, inasmuch as furious gales and “woollies” sweep down
upon it from the steep mountain sides and cañons, so that, without
even a moment’s warning, the traveller’s craft is suddenly stricken,
and compelled to instantly run for shelter under the lee of some
one of the hundreds of islands and capes which stud its waters or
point its coast. Immense glaciers are descending from the cavernous
inlets of the northern and eastern shores, and shedded fragments
of ice, large and small, are cemented by the tide into large
sheets, which are finally swept out and lost in the ocean.</p>

<p>The shores of these canals are formed of high, stupendous mountains
that rise abruptly from the water’s edge perpendicularly, and
often overhanging. The dissolving snow upon their summits gives
rise to thousands upon thousands of little cataracts, which fall with
great impetuosity down their seamed sides and over sheer and rugged
precipices. This fresh water, clear as crystal and cold as winter,
thus descending into the green and blue salt sea, changes that
tone to one of a strange whitish hue in its vicinity, as it also does
in many fiörds of the Sitkan region. This peculiar flood always
arrests attention and excites the liveliest curiosity in the mind of
him who beholds it for the first time. Everywhere, save to the
southward, mountains can be seen looming up in the background
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>with snowy peaks and guttered ridges, and they attest the wild
legends of their sullen grandeur which the first white men related
who ever beheld them. These hardy sailors, when sent out in
the ship <em>Three Saints</em> from Kadiak, in 1788, arrived in the Gulf of
Choogatch, or this Sound of Prince William, during the month of
May. They anchored in a little bay of Noochek Island, and there
established a trading-station. This is the only post, Fort Constantine,
or “Noochek,” that has ever been located by our people in all
this section of a vast wilderness; to-day it is but little changed—a
couple of trading-stores standing on the foundations of Ismailov’s<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
erection, in which the only three white men now known to reside
in all that region of alpine wonder are living, surrounded by a
small village of sixty natives.</p>

<p>The large size of those spruce-trees on the southern slopes of
Kenai Peninsula, Montague, and Noochek Islands of Prince William’s
Sound, so impressed the Russians that they established a
shipyard at Resurrection Bay as early as 1794; by the close of that
year they actually built and launched a double-decker, 73 feet long
by 23 feet beam, of 180 tons burden—the first three-masted, full-rigged
ship ever constructed on the west coast of the North American
continent; she was named the <em>Phœnix</em>, and as she slid from her
ways into the unruffled waters of this far-away place the exultation
and delighted plaudits<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> of her builders echoed in strange discord
with the wild surrounding. Baranov had no paint or even tar, so that
this pioneer ship was covered with a coat of spruce-gum, ochre,
and whale-oil. A few small vessels only were built after this, inasmuch
as the company found it much more economical to purchase in
European yards the sailing-craft and steamers which it was obliged
to employ: but, to-day the traces of the Russian ship-carpenter’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
axe can be still plainly recognized at many points of the western
coast of the sound, and on Montague Island huge logs, as roughed
out nearly a full century ago, are lying now, as they lay then,
slightly decayed in many instances; the anticipation which felled
them was never realized, and they have never been disturbed consequently.</p>

<p>In these early colonial Alaskan days, Fort St. Constantine, or
Noochek Island, was a very important trading-centre; it was visited
by all the tribes living on the Mount St. Elias sea-wall to the
eastward as far as Yakootat, and also by the Copper Indians.
Then the sea-otter was abundant, and in its ardent chase those
Choogatch savages captured, incidentally, large numbers of black
and brown bears, marten, and mink. Now, with the practical extermination
of the sea-otter, we find a very poor lot of natives at
this once flourishing post; but, for the means of a simple physical
existence, they have no lack of an abundant supply of salmon,
seal-blubber and flesh—meat of the marmot, porcupine, and bear,
varied by the frequent killing of mountain sheep, which are found
all over this alpine range; fine foxes are plentiful too.</p>

<p>These Indians live in houses partly underground, which we shall
describe as we visit Kadiak, and in purely race-characteristics those
people also closely resemble the Kadiak Eskimo. From the north of
the Copper River, however, toward the Sitkan archipelago, the
Koloshian or Thlinket is dominant in the form and features of
those savages which we find in a few small and widely separated
villages that exist on the narrow table-land between the high
mountains and the unbroken swell of the ocean. These natives all,
however, agree in describing their country as an excellent hunting-ground,
well timbered, and traversed by numerous small streams
which take their rise in the glaciers and eternal snows of the St.
Elias Alps.</p>

<p>By some happy dispensation of the Creator every savage is so
constituted that here in Alaska, at least, he believes in his own particular
area of existence as the very best realm of the earth—he
becomes homesick and refuses to be comforted if taken to California
or Oregon, enters into a slow decline, and soon dies if not
returned to the dreary spot of his birth—a sad illustration of fatal
nostalgia.</p>

<p>An Alaskan Indian or Innuit has very little of what may be
styled true slavish superstition; certainly he is credulous, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
rather encourages it for the sake of the romance. He gives slight
attention to augurs or omens; he ventures out in search of food
alike under all sorts of varying conditions of health and weather; he
has a few charms or amulets, but does not surrender to them by
any means. Shamans, or sorcerers, never have had the influence
with him that they have exerted in the barbarism of our own ancestry,
and which they possess among the savages of Central and South
America and Africa to-day. It is no solution of this difference in
disposition to call him stupid, for it is not true; he is far more
alert, mentally, than the ghost-ridden Australian, or fetich-slave of
Africa; and, again, the sun-worshipping and intensely superstitious
Incas were far superior, intellectually, to him.</p>

<p>Most of the Innuits give hardly a thought to the subject, yet
they are exceedingly vivacious and social among themselves; much
more so than the Indians. They relate a great many supernatural
stories, but it is only in amusement, and it seldom ever provokes
serious attention.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> When the surveying parties of the War Department were ascending Copper
River last summer, certain Indians, who had been instrumental in slaying
the Russian party of Seribniekov in 1848, were very much alarmed. They
were sure that the fates had come for them at last. One of these natives, an
aged man, now wholly blind, was reported as saying that he was ready to die,
and knew what the white men wanted. This old fellow, Lieutenant Allen
says, was one of the finest-looking savages that he ever saw. The face of the
blind man was one of remarkable character—a large, massive head, high
aquiline nose, with a full, thin-lipped mouth and broad forehead. He was
totally blind and his hair white as snow.</p>

<p>The Russian party were sleeping in their sledges, which they compelled
the natives to draw while ascending the river. At a preconcerted signal the
unwilling Indians turned and brained their taskmasters with hatchets. These
natives had welcomed the Russians; but when they were made to perform
the labor of dogs they turned upon their white oppressors, naturally. The
massacre of Seribniekov and his party in this manner made the Indians very
restless and determined in their opposition to further intercourse with the
Russians. The memory of hostility has, however, died out, and nothing of
the kind was shown to our people last year as they charted the valley and
river.</p>

<p class="no-indent">That volcanic energy and amazing natural variation of the region
known as Cook’s Inlet, and the Peninsula of Alaska, endow it
with a certain fascination which it is hard to adequately define
in words, and difficult to portray. The rugged, uninviting boldness
of the Kenai Mountains turn us abruptly, after our departure
at Noochek, to the southward, where, in an unbroken frowning
cordon of one hundred and fifty miles in length, they bar us out
from the waters of that striking estuary—the greatest on the northwest
coast, which is so well exhibited by the map to everybody as
Cook’s Inlet. But it is known only in name—not by the faintest
appreciation, even, of its real character and of its strange belongings.</p>

<p>Two and three hundred miles still farther north than Sitka it
does not in itself present that increased wintry aspect at any season
of the year which would be most naturally looked for—but it does
offer, in physical contour and phenomena, a most marked contrast
to the Alexander archipelago and its people. It is an exceedingly
dangerous and difficult arm of the sea to navigate, and prompts an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
involuntary thought of admiration for the nautical genius, skill, and
courage of Captain Cook, who sailed up to the very head of this
entirely unknown gulf, in 1778, seeking that mythical northwest
passage round the continent—his dauntless exploration to the utter
limit of Turnagain Canal—his extraordinary retreat in his clumsy
ships, and safe threading of his way out and through the hundreds
of then absolutely nameless and chartless islets and reefs to the
shoals of Bering Sea—all this, viewed to-day, seems simply marvellous,
that he should have escaped all these dangers which the best
sailor now hesitates to undertake, even with excellent courses laid
down and determined for him.</p>

<p>The ship’s entrance to this great land-locked gulf, which the
Russians named, for many years, the Bay of Kenai, lies between
the extreme end of that peninsula called Cape Elizabeth, and Cape
Douglas, which is a bold promontory jutting out from the Alaskan
mainland. Nearly half-way between the two points is a group of
bleak, naked islets, the Barren Islands: around them the tide-rips
of this channel, which they obstruct, boil in savage fury, and are the
dread of every navigator, civilized or Innuit, who is brought near
to them; these violent and irregular tidal currents here, even in
perfectly calm weather, will toss the waters so that the wildest fury
of a tempest elsewhere cannot raise so great a disturbance over the
sea, or one which will so quickly wash a vessel under.</p>

<p>When your ship, bound in, passes this Alaskan “Hell Gate,”
she enters into a broad and ample expanse of water caused by the
widening effect of two large bays which are just opposed to each
other on the opposite shores. The coast of the Kenai Peninsula is
low, the mountains contiguous are not high, though toward the
interior the ridges become much loftier; but everywhere between
them and this coast-line is that characteristic marshy tundra of the
Arctic—a low, flat, broad strip, varying in width from forty to
fifty miles, through which sluggishly flow a multitude of streams
and brooks, wooded with birch, poplar, and spruce everywhere on
the banks, but bare of timber over the great bulk of its expanse.
As the inlet contracts still further, especially at the point between
the two headlands of East and West Foreland, the tide again increases
in velocity and violence of action until it attains a speed of
eight and nine knots an hour, with an average vertical rise and fall
of twenty-four to twenty-six feet. The northeastern extremity of
this large arm of the sea, which Cook entered with the confident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
hope of finding a watery circuit of a continent, and, being disappointed,
applied to it the name of “Turnagain,” presents a tidal
phenomena equal to that so well recognized in the Bay of Fundy.
Here the tide comes in with a thundering roar, raising a “bore”
wave that advances like an express train in rapidity, carrying everything
before it in its resistless onward, upward sweep. High
banks of clay and gravel, which at low-tide seem as though they
were far removed from submersion, are flooded instantly, to remain
so until the ebb takes place. The natives never fail to remember
the angry warning of this incoming tide; they always hurriedly
rush out of their huts, scan quickly everything surrounding, lest
some utensil, some canoe, or basket-weir be thoughtlessly left
within the remorseless rush of that swift-coming flood.</p>

<p>Those glacial sheets which fill countless ravines and cañons in the
mountain ridges at the head of Cook’s Inlet, especially of Turnagain
Canal, and avalanches of snow, from their lofty cradles thereon, all
sweep down together upon the wooded flanks below, and are thus
destroying great belts of forest and piling up innumerable heaps of
rocky débris to such an extent as to often change the superficial
aspect of an entire section of country from season to season; meanwhile
the tide rushing up and down over this drift of avalanches
and glaciers, carries the débris hither and thither, so as to constantly
alter the channels, and the very outlines of the coast itself.</p>

<p>One of the oldest and best of Russian posts was early established
on the Kenai Peninsula, a few miles to the southward of that
narrowing of Cook’s Inlet, caused by the two Forelands. On the
low banks of the Kinik River, and facing the gulf, the ruins of the
“Redoubt St. Nicholas” are still to be plainly seen, though at the
time of the transfer of the Territory, this old post was yet fortified
with a high stockade and octagonal bastions. But both stockade
and bastions have disappeared since then; a number of new frame
buildings have been erected close by, and quite a colony of Russian
half-breeds are living here now, trading, and growing, to better advantage
than anywhere else in Alaska, fair crops of potatoes and
turnips. They keep a few hardy cattle, and it is said that as much
as ten or twelve acres of ground are under cultivation by them.</p>

<p>The aspect of the country surrounding this settlement is much
more suggestive of farming and cattle-raising than is that presented
anywhere else in the Alaskan Territory. The land is rolling and
hilly, the higher eminences being covered with thick spruce forests;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
but as you advance into the interior, great swamps of tangled
heather, fir, jungle, and sphagnum are prevalent. The soil everywhere,
not covered with grass and forest, is mossy, with a little
grass and many bushes. The trees are large, fifty to sixty feet
high, and eighteen inches to twenty-four in diameter, mostly spruce—no
cedar or hemlock. That district adjoining the East Foreland
Head is, perhaps, the best with reference to dry, fertile soil, for, in
its vicinity, there are broad plains where wild timothy and red-top
grasses grow to the height of your waist and shoulders. An
extended experience of the Russians taught them to locate their
agricultural operations here; that the coast-line belt of the Kenai
Peninsula, between the Forelands and Kooshiemak Bay, a belt of
low and semi-prairie uplands some eighty miles in length, and varying
in depth from ten to twenty, was the most eligible base of
agricultural effort afforded anywhere in Alaska, the quality of the
crops always being best near the coast, the soil being drier, and the
danger of little nipping summer-frosts wholly abated.</p>

<p>The several small settlements which we find upon this pastoral
strip to-day have a curious history, as to the origin of their inhabitants.
About the period of 1836-38, the expenses of the Russian
American Company in maintaining their trading stations in Alaska
were increasing to an alarming degree, while the receipts remained
stationary, or fell off. An enquiry into its cause revealed it. The
fact was, that hundreds of superannuated employés were drawing
their salaries and subsistence, rendering no adequate return for
the same. These persons had grown old, and had lost their health
in serving the company; were, nearly all of them, infirm survivors
of Shellikov and Baranov’s parties, whose daring and energy had
established the company. It would be inhuman to discharge these
aged and crippled Russians, and throw them upon their own resources
in such a region. After much deliberation the company
was authorized by the Crown to make the following terms of settlement
and relief, and thus locate them as permanent pensioners and
settlers in the country. Therefore all of the old employés who had
married or lived with native or half-breed women, and who were
unable to successfully engage in the trading avocations of the company,
by reason of age and other infirmities, were, upon their written
or witnessed request, after being stricken from the pay-rolls,
provided for in this manner.</p>

<p>The company was obliged to select and donate a piece of ground,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
build a comfortable dwelling, furnish agricultural tools, seeds, cattle
and fowls, and supply the pensioner receiving all this with provisions
enough to support him and his wife for one year. These
“old colonial citizens” (as they were called), thus established, were
then exempted from all taxation, military duty, or molestation
whatsoever, and a list of their names was annually forwarded in the
reports of the company. The children of those settlers were at liberty
to enter or not, as they pleased, the service of the company at
stated salaries. The company, furthermore, was commanded to purchase
all the surplus produce of these pensioners, furs, and dried
fish, etc. This order of the Crown, thus fixing the status of those
old servants, also included the half-breeds who were equally infirm
by reason of such service. Such whites, or Russians, were officially
designated “colonial citizens,” the half-breeds were styled “colonial
settlers.”</p>

<p>The descendants of these pensioned servants of the Russian
Company are the men and women you observe to-day in those little
hamlets scattered along the east coast of Cook’s Inlet, or the Kenai
Peninsula. They are bright, clean, and, though very, very poor,
still appear wholly independent. They are engaged in small trading
with the Kenaitze savages and in their limited agricultural
efforts, whereby they have potatoes, turnips, and other hardy vegetables.
The cattle, of which they have a few in each settlement,
are of the small, shaggy Siberian breed, not much larger than
Shetland ponies, and capable of living in the rigors of a winter
which would destroy or permanently injure our breeds of neat cattle.
These people make butter by laboriously shaking the milk in
bottles.</p>

<p>They are obliged to shelter their cattle during winters from
the driving fury of heavy snow-storms, and when the herd ranges
in the grass-season, the boys and old men always have to guard it
from the deadly attention of the big brown bears which infest the
entire region. They have a regular “round-up” in each hamlet
every night.</p>

</figure>

<p>Everywhere on the west coast of Cook’s Inlet the mountains rise
steeply and rugged from the sea, a wild and uninviting contrast
with the park-like terraces of the Kenai coast just opposite. Here
are the same lofty ridges and smoking peaks which startled and
oppressed the brave heart of Captain Cook, as they muttered and
trembled in volcanic throes when he sailed by. The two cones
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>which rise dominant are the summits of Mount Ilyamna and the
“Rédoute,” from which columns of brownish smoke ascend by
day and ruddy fire-glowings by night. So precipitous is this mainland
shore of Cook’s Inlet that at only two small points of the most
limited area is there any low land to be found, and these spots
have been promptly utilized by the Kenaitze Indians as sites for
their villages of Toyonok and Kustatan. The dense, sombre coniferous
forest which we have become so familiar with, clothes the
flanks of those grim mountain walls with the thickest of all coverings
to a height of one thousand feet above the beaches below.
Here and there we glance into the recesses of a cañon or a gorge
where the naked, mossy surface of immense rocky declivities arrests
and fixes the eye, while the glittering caps of ice and snow
far away above fit down snugly upon long, rough, treeless intervals,
covered with heather, lichens, and varied arctic sphagnum.</p>

<p>The upper waters of Cook’s Inlet are said to be quite remarkable
for their barrenness of fish—salmon only being plenty in the
running season, ascending all the numerous rivers and rivulets; the
reason most likely is due to the turbid upheaval of the bottoms
everywhere by that violent tidal bore which prevails, recurring
twice every twenty-four hours. The Indians here employ a curious
trestle or staging of poles, which they use in spearing salmon, and
netting them from its support.</p>

<p>An extensive spread of the largest fresh-water lake in Alaska
just over the divide from Cook’s Inlet, early led the Russians to explore
it, and to find a portage via its waters to the sea of Bering.
But, though this barrier can be passed by an active man in a
single day, yet it has divided, and continues to absolutely separate,
two distinct races of savages—the Innuits from the Indians; for
the Kenaitze are Indians, as we understand them, based upon our
types of the great plains and foothills of the Rocky Mountains;
and, living here as they do on the shores of Cook’s Inlet, they live,
perhaps, in the most romantic and picturesque region of Alaska.
Burning volcanoes, smoking and grumbling, a large inland sea rolling
for miles and miles therein, and lay at their feet; wide watery
moors, tundra, timber and lakes, and rivers rising in the snow-white
peaks everywhere visible, all combine to make the most striking
lights and shades of natural scenery that human thought can realize
in fancy.</p>

</figure>

<p>These natives of Cook’s Inlet are strongly defined from those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Kadiak as a separate people, both in language (which no white man
has ever been able to repeat), in appearance, and in disposition.
They are true Athabascans, or exactly like the meat-eating Indians
of our great North American interior. An average man here is an
Indian of medium height, say five feet seven or nine inches, well
built and symmetrical, lithe and sinewy. The cold glint of his
small, jet-black eyes is not relieved by any expression of good humor
in his taciturn features and physical bearing. His nose will present,
as a rule, the full aquiline or Julius Cæsar outline. Their
skin is darker than that of the Innuit, though now and then a
comely young person will show perceptible blood-mantlings to the
cheeks. The mouth is large—lips rather full; beardless faces are
the rule. Their women are much better-looking than either the
Siwash squaws of the Sitkan region, or the females of the Aleutian
and Innuit races. Their hair is worn in clubbed bunches and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
braids, hanging upon their backs, thickly larded over with grease,
and often powdered with feathers and geese-down.</p>

<p>In the immediate vicinity of the shores of Cook’s Inlet the
primitive habits of these savages have been very much changed by
their daily intercourse with the Creoles; but at the head of the
gulf, especially in the Sooshetno and Keknoo valleys, they are still
dressed in their deer-skin shirts and trousers, men and women
alike. They work those garments with a great variety of beads,
porcupine quills stained in bright colors, and grass plaitings.</p>

<p>These Kenaitze are the only real hunters in all Alaska. They
place little or no dependence on fish like the other tribes, unless we
except the walrus-eating Eskimo, who hunt, however, in water-craft
entirely. And were they not natural Nimrods, the abundance of
game which abounds in their district would stimulate such ambition
alone in itself. The brown bear<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> of Alaska is found almost
everywhere; but it seems to prefer an open, swampy country to that
dense timber most favored by its ursine relative, the black bear.
It attains its greatest size, and exhibits the most ferocity, on the
Kenai Peninsula. It should be called the grizzly, because it is frequently
shot here fully as large, if not larger,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> than those examples
recorded in Oregon and California.</p>

<p>This wide-ranging brute is found away up beyond the Arctic Circle,
though never coming down to the coast of the icy ocean except
at Kotzebue Sound. It is a most expert fisherman, and a terror to
the reindeer and cariboo of those hyperborean solitudes. It frequents,
during the salmon season, all the Alaskan rivers and their
tributaries which empty into Bering Sea and the North Pacific, as
far as the fish can ascend. When the run for the year is over, then
the animal retires into the thick recesses of semi-timbered uplands
and tundra, where berries and small game, deer especially, are
most abundant.</p>

<p>Everywhere throughout this large extent of Alaska the footpaths,
or roads, of that omnipresent ursine traveller arrest your attention.
The banks of all streams are lined by the well-trodden trails of
these heavy brutes, and offer far better facilities for progress than
those afforded by the paths of men. Not only are the swampy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
plains intersected by such well-worn routes of travel, but the
mountains themselves and ridges, to the very summits thereof, are
thus laid out; and the judgment of a bear in traversing a rough,
mountainous divide is always of the best—his track over is sure to
be the most practicable route. On the steep, volcanic uplands of the
mountainous coast of the west shore in Cook’s Inlet, groups of
twenty, and even thirty, of these huge bears can be seen together
feeding upon the berries and roots which are found there in
season. Their skins are not valuable, however, being “patched”
and harsh-haired. Then they are very fierce, so that they are not
commonly hunted anywhere except by the Kenaitze, who, like all
other aboriginal hunters, respect them profoundly, and invariably
address a few eulogistic words of praise to a bear before killing or
attempting to kill it.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>A peculiar dread which all the natives of this region have, of
visiting those areas where volcanic energy manifests itself, is taken
advantage of by those dumb beasts upon which the savage wages
relentless warfare; the immediate vicinity of craters, of steaming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
hot springs and solfataras, will always be a rendezvous for game,
especially bears, which seem to fully understand that in staying
there they will never be disturbed. But the Kenaitze are ardent
hunters, nevertheless, and spend most of their time and energy in
the chase of land animals—making long journeys into the interior,
and gloomy recesses of mountainous cañons and defiles, to follow
and find the fur-bearing quarry peculiar to their country.</p>

<p>They have regular tracks of main travel, where, like stage stations
on our frontier post-roads, at intervals they have erected
shelter-huts, in which they often live with their families for months
of the year at a time; they make birch-bark canoes for their river
and lake transit, but in navigating Cook’s Inlet, they buy skin
bidarkas of the Kadiak model and use them altogether. They are
fairly independent of salt water, and seldom pass many hours upon
it, except in travelling and trading one with another, and the
Creoles; they are, however, very expert at fresh-water fishing
through holes in the ice for trout in the thousand and one lakes,
large and small, which are so common in their country.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>As these natives live in their permanent settlements, we find
them distinguished by a peculiar architecture. Their houses are
fashioned out of logs, and set above ground resting upon its surface;
the logs are hollowed out on one side so as to fit one upon
the other in true spoon-fashion, and make a really air and water-tight
wall; an enclosure of these walls will hardly ever be larger
than 20 feet square, and most of them never go over 12 or 15 feet;
they have regularly laid cross-rafters, with a low, or half-pitch, over
which spruce-bark shells are so spread as to shed rain and drifting
snow; these shingle slabs are kept in place by a number of heavy
poles, lashed transversely across; a fireplace is always in the centre
with a very small smoke-hole opened in the roof just above it;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the door is a square aperture cut through the logs at the least exposed
front, about large enough to easily admit the ingress and
egress of a crouching Indian. It is stopped in stormy weather by
a bear-skin, hung so as to fall directly over it from the inside.
When the door is thus closed the naturally dark interior becomes
almost wholly so; but the howling of a tempest, laden with rain, sleet
or snow, as the case may be, renders this gloomy indoor perfectly
radiant to the senses of its sheltered inmates, and they loll in robes
and blankets and doze away the time on the rude wooden platform
which surrounds the walls and keeps their bodies from the cold
damp earth. Upon this staging they spread grass mats and skins,
and, in fact, it is a catchall for everything.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">The Bedroom Annex of a Kenaitze Rancherie.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>An odd feature seen in some of the most pretentious houses of
those inlet savages, is the presence of a little kennel-like bedroom
annex, which many of the most wealthy or important have built up
against the main walls. These boxlike additions are tightly framed
and joined to the houses, the only entrance being from the inside
of the main structure by a small hole cut directly through the
logs of the wall; they are sleeping chambers, and are furnished
with a rough plank floor, and sometimes a window made of a piece
of translucent bladder-gut. They are also reserved and special
apartments during the occasion of those visits of ceremony which
Indians often pay, one to each other. But the main idea is to
have these tight little dormitories so snug and warm that they will
insure the comfortable rest of the owner therein without much
burdensome bed-clothing—in many cases the Kenaitze can sleep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
here in the coldest weather without any covering at all, and do.
Such a bed is a great and priceless luxury to them.</p>

<p>No furniture annoys the Kenai housekeeper, unless the small
square blocks of wood used occasionally as stools or seats can be so
styled; the grease and fire-boxes which we have seen in Sitkan
households are also duplicated here, but though made of wood
they are not so neatly put together. The traders recently have
introduced a very novel feature to the interior of nearly every
Kenaitze house; it is the common, cheap, box-imitation, in miniature,
of a Saratoga trunk with lock and key. Those oddly contrasted
articles will be found everywhere among these people, who keep
in them all their valuables, such as charms, and toys for the
children, flashy handkerchiefs, small tools fashioned out of bits of
iron and steel, bags of thread and stripped sinews, needles,
ammunition, and their percussion-caps, which are to them as pearls
without price—nothing so precious. Outside of this trunk-craze,
and their odd sleeping-rooms, these Indians do not live together or
act differently from the usual habit and manner of savages proper,
so familiar to us by reason of repeated descriptions published of
our own meat-eaters who live near by. They crave nothing from
the white trader save powder, lead, good rifles, percussion-caps,
tobacco, calico, and the sham trunks alluded to.</p>

<p>The sun shines out over Cook’s Inlet much more than it does
in the Sitkan region and the Aleutian Islands. The proportion of
fair, bright weather is larger than that experienced anywhere else in
all Alaska or its coast. The winter months here are not excessively
cold; snow falls in December—sometimes as late as 3d of January
before the first flakes of the season arrive. By the first to
middle of May it has usually melted away on the lowlands, and the
grass springs up anew, green and luxuriant. Summer, and even
winter storms, are drawn along the lofty ranges of the Kenai Peninsula
when all is serene and pleasant at the same time on the moors
and lowlands of the inlet shores. Often, too, the people of that
coast can look up to a continued falling of heavy rain and snow
on the mountain summits of the steep ridges across the inlet, while
they bask in unclouded sunshine, and have no interruption of its
comfort.</p>

<p>We ourselves have as yet made but slight use of the natural
resources and advantages of Cook’s Inlet. A party of San Francisco
merchants have established at the mouth of the Kassilov<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
River a salmon cannery, which has been worked to the full limit
of demand; and a smaller, similar factory is located at the head of
this inlet, in the Kaknoo estuary.</p>

<p>The finest salmon known to man, savage or civilized, both in
flavor and size combined, is that giant fish which runs in especial
good form and number into Cook’s Inlet, and which the Russians
called the “chowichah;”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> they are most abundant during the summer
neap-tides, but they are not as numerous as are the several other
varieties of smaller and far less palatable salmonidæ, which also run
up here with them. The average length of these superb chowichah
fish is four feet, and a weight of fifty pounds is a low medium.
They appear regularly on the 20th and 22d of every May, running
in pairs, refusing the hook, though hugging the shore lines. Our
people catch them in floating gill-nets, and in weirs of brush and
saplings of wicker-work woven with spruce-roots and bark, which
are erected on the mud-flats at the river mouth, during low tide.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Method employed by Indians of Cook’s Inlet to catch Salmon</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The king salmon, however, is erratic in running to any one
spawning spot, and in this respect differs from all the rest of its
family, which is remarkably constant in annually returning to the
same spawning ground. But the abundance of salmon which we see
in their reproductive periods of each year, ascending every river
and possible rivulet that communicates with the sea in Alaska south
of Bering’s Straits, is a never-failing source of wonder and delight
to the white visitor and a measure of infinite creature-comfort
to his physical being while sojourning here. Also, the pleasant
thought constantly arises that when we shall have a populous empire
on the Pacific slope, as we have now in the Mississippi Valley
and east of the Alleghanies, what a handsome use we will make of
this waste of fish-food wealth<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> which we now observe in the vast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>realm of its indulgence throughout Alaska. Also in another, but
wholly correct sense, the natives themselves shamefully waste the
flesh of those fine salmon. To illustrate the extraordinary nature of
this suggestion, let the following statements of fact be recalled:
The native population of Cook’s Inlet is not large—it is embraced in
about one hundred and sixty-eight families, averaging four souls to
each household; everyone of these families prepares at least seven
hundred and fifty to eight hundred pounds of dried salmon for its
own specific consumption during the winter months. That amount
of cured fish, therefore, is about one hundred and twenty-six thousand
pounds, and as every pound weight of dried meat is equal to
an original weight of at least eight or nine pounds of fresh, or undried,
then this cured total gives us an immense aggregate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
1,000,000 pounds of fresh salmon; this, figured down, shows that
a single Indian uses, during the winter solstice—five months—the
enormous amount of 1,430 pounds of this rich-meated article of
diet, or about ten pounds every day, in addition to the bear-meat,
deer, and sheep-meat, seal and beluga oil, berries and roots which
he is constantly consuming, at the same time, in the greatest freedom,
and which are always in abundant supply. The full thought
of my presentation will be better understood when it is remembered
that a pound of fresh salmon has more nourishing and sustaining
quality than the same amount dried. The salt-dried codfish with
which we are so familiar is very different in its texture, and weighs
many times more than it would if it were cured by the air and
smoke-exposure to which the natives of Alaska are driven in preserving
their fish.</p>

<p>An exceedingly happy illustration of the singular force of habit
which the salmon have in returning every recurring season to
the exact localities of their birth was afforded near the Creole settlement
of Neelshik on the Kenai Inlet coast. A small stream runs
down to the gulf from the mountains and moors of the interior.
Its mouth had been closed by a barrier of surf-raised sand and
gravel during storms in the winter of 1879-80, and through which the
sluggish stream filtered in its course without overflowing. When the
salmon, which had descended the year previously from the upper
waters of the stream in the course of their reproductive circuit,
again returned to renew such labors in the following season, this
unexpected wall barred their ingress. They did not turn away, but
actually leaped out upon this sandy spit, and many of them succeeded,
by spasmodic springs and wriggling, while on the dry gravel,
in getting across and into the river-water beyond! the Creoles, in
the meantime, having nothing to do except to walk down from
their houses and gather up the self-stranded salmon as they fancied
their size and condition. Inasmuch as these “old colonial settlers”
are very pious, as well as very indolent, they were profuse in giving
thanks to their patron saints for this unexpected bounty.</p>

<p>The color of gold everywhere found by washing the sands of
Cook’s Inlet on the Kenai shore early aroused the cupidity of the
Russians. They made systematic examinations here under the lead
of experienced men, between 1848 and 1855, and the Russian American
Company spent a great deal of money in the same time by sustaining
a large force of forty miners, directed by Lieutenant Doroshin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
in active operations at the head of the inlet on the Kaknoo
River, and in the Kenai Mountains and Prince William or Choogatch
Alps. Gold was found, but in such small quantities, compared
with the labor of getting it, that the ardor of the Russians soon
cooled, and nothing as yet has resulted from the prospecting of our
own miners in this district, who have been all over these Slavonian
trails since the transfer.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="label">[46]</a> Dr. T. H. Bean, who, as a trained ichthyologist, passed the season of
1880 investigating the fish of Alaska by cruising throughout its waters, says:</p>

<p>“The greatest fish-wealth of Alaska, so far as the shore fisheries are concerned,
lies in the abundance of salmon of the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oncorhynchus</i>, which is
represented by five species—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chouicha</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">keta</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">kisutch</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nerka</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gorbuscha</i>.
The first three of these are the largest, the whole series being named in the
order of their size. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">O. chouicha</i> is the giant of the group, and is the most
important commercially; it attains to its greatest size in the large rivers,
which it ascends long distances in its spawning season. In Alaska it is known
to extend as far north as Bering Strait, and it is especially abundant in Cook’s
Inlet and in the Yukon. Individuals weighing nearly one hundred pounds
are occasionally reported from these waters, and even in the Columbia. The
finest product of this salmon is the salted bellies, which are prepared principally
on the Kenai, Kassilov, and Yukon Rivers; the fame of this luxury
once extended to the centre of government in Russia, The well-known
‘quinnat salmon’ is the same species; its importance, as evidenced by the
efforts of the United States Fish Commission and other commissions toward
its propagation and distribution, is too well understood to require additional
mention. The great bulk of the salted salmon exported from Alaska are the
small ‘red fish,’ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">O. nerka</i>; and this species is sought after simply on account
of the beautiful color of the flesh and not for its intrinsic value, which is far
below that of most of the other species. All the salmon extend northward to
Bering Strait, but only one, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gorbuscha</i>, is reported as occurring north of the
Arctic Circle; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gorbuscha</i> is said by trustworthy parties to reach the Colville
River. In the early part of its run the flesh of this little ‘humpback’ seems
to me to be particularly good. Other members of the family of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salmonidæ</i>,
and very important ones, are the species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salmo</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">purpuratus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gairdneri</i>)
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salvelinus malma</i>, two of which reach a large size in Alaska. The first
two are not known to exist much to the northward of Unalashka, while <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">malma</i>
is believed to extend to the Colville. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. gairdneri</i> resembles the Atlantic
salmon in size and shape, but its habits are different; it is found filled with
mature eggs in June. I have not seen any very large examples of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. purpuratus</i>
from the Territory, but the species is extremely abundant and valuable
for food. The red-spotted char, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. malma</i>, is everywhere plentiful and is
highly esteemed as a food-fish; it grows much larger in Northern Alaska than
in California, and has some commercial value as an export in its sea-run condition
under the name of ‘salmon trout.’ Natives of Alaska make water-proof
clothing from the skins of this fish.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">The boldest and the most striking cape in this wilderness of bluffy
headlands and jutting promontories is that point which marks the
dividing line between the Kadiak region and Cook’s Inlet—Cape
Douglas. It is a lofty alpine ridge or spur, abruptly thrust out at
a right angle to the coast, and into and over the sea for a distance
of three miles, where it drops suddenly with a sheer precipitous
fall of over one thousand feet into the waves that thunder on its
everlasting foundations. Baffling winds here, and turbulent tide-rips
distress that navigator who, coming down from the inlet, seeks
the harbor of St. Paul’s village. He hardly regards this seared
and rugged headland with that admiration which the geologist and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
the artist always will. The “woollies,” which blow fiercely off
from it, worry him and challenge all his nautical skill.</p>

<p>Kadiak Island is the centre, geographical and commercial, of a
most interesting and wide-extended district, perhaps the most so,
of the Alaskan Territory, and Kadiak village, or Saint Paul Harbor
is, in turn, the central and all-important settlement of this district.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
It was the site of the first grand depot of the old Russian American
Company, and also the location of the first missionary establishment
and day-school ever founded on the northwest coast of the
continent. From the quiet moorings of this beautiful Kadiak bay
hundreds of shallops and vessels bearing courageous monks and
priests have set out in every direction over all Alaska, carrying
scores of them to preach the gospel among its savage inhabitants,
who then were savage indeed to all intents and purposes.</p>

<p>The first visit ever made by white men to the great Island of
Kadiak was the landing here in the autumn of 1763, at Alikitak Bay,
of Stepan Glottov, a Russian sea-otter trader, who went into winter-quarters
at the southeastern extremity of the island, on a spot now
called Kahgooak settlement. The natives were ugly, hostile, refused
all intercourse, and kept the Russians in a chronic state of
fear. Scurvy broke out in their camp and nearly destroyed the invaders,
leaving less than one-third of them alive in the spring.
They managed then, with the greatest effort, to launch their vessel
and get away, the savages meanwhile constantly attempting to finish
that destruction which bodily disease had so well-nigh effected.</p>

<p>The beginning of the eighth decade of the eighteenth century
is a true date of the real epoch of Russian domination in Alaska.
All history of white exploration in this country prior to that is simply
the cruel legend of an eager, heartless band of outraging Muscovites,
doing everything just for the gain of the present moment,
sowing so badly that they dared not remain and reap. One of those
big-brained, cool, and indomitable Russians, who gave then as they
give now, the stamp of high character to the race, was for several
years prior to 1780 prominently engaged in the American fur trade.
Grigor Ivan Shellikov was this man. He was a citizen of the Siberian
town of Roolsk. He resolved to survey in person those scenes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
of rapid demoralization and ruin to the profitable prosecution of his
Alaskan business, and, if possible, to attempt a change for the better.
An evident decrease in furs, together with the hostile attitude
of the natives, provoked altogether by their inhuman treatment
at the hands of the “promishlyniks,” called for reform in the most
emphatic manner. After a carefully deliberated plan of action had
been determined upon between himself and his partners, the brothers
Gollikov, he at once proceeded to the Okotsk Sea and fitted out
three small vessels for his expedition.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> He did not reach Kadiak
until 1784, two years after starting out, when two of his vessels
came to anchor in the harbor now known, as it was then christened
by him, Three Saints Bay. Shellikov was a ready and willing correspondent.
His numerous letters to his Siberian partners and his
own published “Journeys” give us a clear idea of the hardihood
of his enterprise, and they have a rare ethnographic value. From
them we learn of the great liking which Shellikov’s party took to
the Island of Kadiak, and how they resolved, soon after making a
short reconnoissance, to establish themselves permanently if they
could gain the confidence of its savage inhabitants.</p>

<p>Shellikov sent out a scouting party and captured a Kaniag,
brought him into camp, and loaded the bewildered native with presents
and kindness, then sent him back to his people; but the
native, though won wholly over himself,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> could not prevail upon
his hostile countrymen, who soon gave the Russians ample evidence
of their enmity. A party of the latter in two of the ships’ boats
were exploring and hunting, when they were disturbed by the appearance
of a “perfect cloud” of natives that were encamped on
rough and precipitous uplands of Oogak Island, a short distance
from the main island itself. Shellikov resolved to proceed himself to
the spot and endeavor to win them over to amity and trade. He exhausted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
every art of pacification that his ready wit could suggest
without making the slightest favorable impression upon these men,
who treasured up in the liveliest recollection those outrages and indignities
which they had hitherto suffered from the arms and vices
of Shellikov’s Muscovitic predecessors. The only answer that they
made to the trader now was that he at once embark and leave the
island, and a few arrows and bird-spears were discharged and
thrown at him by way of clinching the argument. The Russians
retired to their camp, and wisely erected over day a rude stockade—none
too quick, for these Kaniags approached the harbor in the
middle of the night, unobserved, and threw themselves with frenzied
fury upon the slightly fortified Russians. The battle lasted
until daylight. The necessity and instinct of self-preservation
caused the whites to fight with desperate coolness and intrepidity.
The slaughter was great among the natives, and, considering the
vastly inferior numbers of the Russians, their loss, too, was heavy.
In spite of the bravery of the whites in this terrible midnight struggle,
they would have been overpowered and exterminated ere the
dawning, had it not been for the consternation which the reports
of their small iron two-pounders created in the assailing ranks of
those dusky hosts.</p>

<p>Recognizing the fact that now the only hope of peace and commercial
intercourse with these natives lay in their complete subjugation,
Shellikov, immediately after the sullen retreat of the hostiles,
armed one of his vessels and followed them up to their rocky fortresses
in Oogak, where they had taken up a position that was well-nigh
impregnable, and to which savage reinforcements were rapidly
flocking from the main islands. Unable to reach the entrenched
camp of those defiant natives with the small ship’s-cannon, Shellikov
picked a party of sixty men out of his company, went ashore
with them, and, with his little iron two-pounders, he stormed the
enemy with such impetuosity that the rapid discharges of these guns
and small firearms of the charging Russians utterly demoralized
an immensely superior force of the savages, who became panic-stricken,
and actually jumped by scores off the high bluffs of
Oogak into the sea, hundreds of feet below; the rest of them,
more than a thousand souls, surrendered to the Russians, who took
and located them on a rocky islet, several miles from the harbor of
Three Saints, and temporarily provided them with provisions; and
then, with hunting-gear, they were set to work and liberally paid for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
their peltries. Twenty or thirty of their leaders were kept as hostages
on the vessels, and the result was entire submission everywhere
afterward to the Russians in this region. Occasional attacks
and massacres would now and then be made upon far-distant
hunting parties of the Russians, it is true, but the moral effect of
the Oogak victory and slaughter was such among the Kadiakers
that no further combined organized resistance or opposition was
ever given again.</p>

<p>Shellikov soon realized that he was in no further danger from
savage attacks. He began a most extensive and thorough exploration
of the great island, and organizations of trading-posts at every
eligible point. He sent a large party around to the north side and
located it at Karlook, where we now find quite a salmon-canning
establishment. Here, during the winter of 1785-86 fifty-two Russians
and as many natives ranged all over the water of Shellikov
Straits in eager search of the sea-otter; in the meantime the whites
under Shellikov’s immediate command were actively examining
the recesses and fiörds which are so numerous and deep on the
south side of Kadiak. So well and so thoroughly was this work
carried out, that by the beginning of 1786 Shellikov had made himself
well acquainted with the whole region—had established his
trading-posts at every point between Shooak, in the north, and
Trinity Islands, at the extreme south; and had even made himself
tolerably familiar with the coast of Cook’s Inlet, having chastised
the ugly Kenaitze in a most summary manner.</p>

<p>Again, this remarkable man is distinguished by the successful
and sensible effort which he made in substituting for the orgies of
Kadiak demonology the practices of the Greek Church, which, he
wisely foresaw, if effected, would bind the natives closer to the
Russians than any other power. He was aided in this by the personal
labors and example of his wife, who accompanied him at the
outset. She instructed the girls and women in needle-work, and
acquired an influence over them that was very great. Feeling
certain that he had established his trade on a secure foundation,
Shellikov and his wife sailed for home on May 22, 1786, in the
same vessel which brought them out, leaving an impress of enduring
character upon Alaska of the greatest good and worth.</p>

<p>During the first years of the existence of the Shellikov Company,
thus established here in Kadiak, it enjoyed the partial protection
of the Crown and many exclusive privileges, by which advantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
nearly all the smaller trading companies had been fairly crowded
out of the country. But it was not always the power conferred
upon a great firm by its favor at Court and larger capital that
gained supremacy in Alaska during those early days—it frequently
occurred that the employés of one association resorted to physical
force of arms in dispossessing those of another, and then, this
order initiated, the strongest organization was sure to eventually
dominate the coveted region. This commercial anarchy led to the
autocratic monopoly of the Russian American Company in a very
few years—it was the best thing that could then have transpired
for Alaska and its people.</p>

<p>The approach to Kadiak from the ocean is striking, because
it and the numerous islets and islands that join it closely are
mountainous and hilly, with many lofty peaks that have plateaux
and ravines full of eternal snow. It is not often seen clearly, however,
along its full extent of wild topography, on account of clouds,
fog and boisterous weather, which terrifies the navigator, driving
him from its vision. It is, however, an island that affords the
greatest number of safe and snug harbors, and has no rival as the
most enjoyable place for the traveller to visit. It so justifies us in
our mind to-day, just as it warranted the Russians in expressing
their preference for it a full hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Nature has drawn across Kadiak in a firm line, the ultimate
limit of timber growth to the westward. It seems to be as arbitrary
and capricious as if traced there by the humor of a human
ruler. Only one-third of the island itself, its northern extremity,
is covered with spruce-forest; the invisible barrier to the west
seems to be a perfectly straight line over from the heads of Orlova
Bay on the south side to that of Ooganok on the north coast. Here
the change from a vigorous growth of spruce-forest to bare hills
and grassy tundra is most abrupt and astonishingly sharp in definition;
you pass from the jungle of the woods, at a single step, into
heather of the moor. This line, with a slight curve to the westward
only, strikes the same definition over on the mainland of the peninsula
opposite, and runs right up north to Bering’s Straits’ latitude, avoiding
the coast everywhere except at Cape Denbigh, Norton’s Sound.</p>

<p>There is scarcely any lowland, indeed none at all, on the large
island itself; it is everywhere mountainous and abruptly rolling,
with spaces here and there in which the grasses flourish to a great
extent. A legion of small streams rush down to the bays from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
their mountain sources, but none of them are navigable—they are
mere rapids and cascades in their entire length. A growth of the
characteristic circumpolar annuals and biennials on the slopes of
these hills of Kadiak is of exotic luxuriance, and of the most varied
beauty of floral display in June, July, and August. Willows and
alders fringe the borders of the streams in their range throughout
the woodless area, while stunted birch and green grasses reach to
the very summits of the hilly ridges of the interior.</p>

<p>Although Shellikov had established the headquarters of his
Russian Company on Three Saints Bay with good reason at the
time, yet when the entire Alaskan region went into the control of a
single organization, it became necessary to have a grand central
depot of supplies. Therefore Baranov promptly removed to the
site of the present village of Kadiak. Upon that wooded island in
the offing he procured the lumber and timbers necessary for the
erection of those huge warehouses and numerous dwellings of many
sizes required to house the merchandise, furs, and his employés.
The harbor, too, is ample, and so situated that sailing-craft can
come and go in all winds. Sadly, indeed, did the Russians, a few
years later, abandon Kadiak for Sitka, as the numerous letters and
protests still on file show; but the menacing encroachments of foreign
traders in the far-distant Alexander archipelago were too grave
in their portents of loss and usurpation of vested rights to allow of
any other action.</p>

<p>To-day many of the ancient Russian structures are still pointed
out in the village here which commands the harbor of Saint Paul,
and in which some three hundred Creoles are living in well-built
log and frame houses. Everything is clean<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and orderly, but very,
very quiet, inasmuch as no commerce, no monthly steamer, no
tramping miners invade the solitude of its location. It supports a
large Greek church and the priest attendant. Its people, as a rule,
are wholly engaged in the business of trading fur and hunting sea-otters.
Small codfish schooners often rendezvous here, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
natives also cut considerable cord-wood, for the use of such fur-traders
who ply to the treeless districts westward, and fuel
for fishing canneries at Karlook and Kassilov. Several little
mountain rivulets flow through the limits of this settlement, which
is everywhere well drained, and therefore dry in the streets by reason
of its position on the rising slopes of the lofty hills which
make a bold background, when the picture is viewed from the ship’s
deck as you sail up to the anchorage. The presence here of some
thirty white men, pure Russian Creoles, and several of our own
people who have really settled in the country, many of them married,
and who call the place home, makes Kadiak unique in this respect.
Elsewhere, if we find a white man living at the trading-posts,
or plying his vocation as a cod-salmon fisherman, or miner,
he always draws himself up and emphatically denies any idea of
permanent residence in Alaska.</p>

<p>Looking down the bay, we observe a thickly timbered and a
somewhat more level island than usual—it is the famous Wood
Island, where the largest spruce-trees in all this section grow; upon
it is a small village of one hundred and fifty-six souls, living in
thirteen log houses, thickly clustered together; they are all sea-otter
hunters during the summer. This village is also the depot of
that mysterious San Francisco corporation which has regularly cut
up and stored tons of ice here every winter since 1856, and never
has shipped a pound of it away! and when the bright, hearty agent
of this corporation asks you to come out with him to the stable and
advises you to mount one of the three or four horses sheltered
therein, so that you can gallop round the island with him, your
astonishment is perfect.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there is a road, incredible as it first seemed;
for, in order that the horses might be exercised, a good track has
been made upon the entire tide-level circuit of the island, about
twelve miles in length, over which the ice company’s stock is trotted
every summer at frequent intervals; in the winter these unwonted
animals are busy hauling ice. You may well improve this opportunity,
for it will not occur again as you travel in Alaska—you will
not be able to ride elsewhere on a road worthy of the name.</p>

<p>A number of small trading-sloops and schooners have been built
here in a boatyard, fashioned by the skill of some Creole ship-carpenters,
who were trained in the yards at Sitka when Russian
authority was dominant, and who have taken up their permanent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
abode in this “Leesnoi” settlement. A few small, tough Siberian
cattle, such as we saw at Neelshik, Cook’s Inlet, are roaming about
here, cared for by the natives who prize milk; also several of these
same bovines are to be seen at Kadiak, where they are limited also
to a few head, on account of the trouble of winter attendance and
loss from bears in the summer pasturage.</p>

<p>An odd, weather-beaten faded little building is pointed out by
the natives with pride and animation, as the house in which a
“soul-like man”—a Russian monk made his abode for thirty consecutive
years, teaching the children of the village and those of
the neighboring towns, who flocked here in great numbers to be
instructed. He taught the Russian alphabet, so that the church
service might be intelligible; also rudimentary art-principles,
gardening and divers useful habits for such youth. This unique
shrine is in the heart of the next village closely adjoining, and
which is located on Spruce Island, or “Yealovnie,” as the seventy
odd Russian Creoles who live there call it. It is a little hamlet
of only fifteen small log houses, very neat and clean; and the prettiest
of flower-pots within the scant windows give you a far-away
thought as you observe them. Here is also one of the tiniest of
Greek chapels, in which the natives are regularly joined by the
small number of those of Oozinkie village (a little way off) and just
across the straits; these people, who have no church, are also pure
Creoles, and unite in perfect accord with those of Spruce town.</p>

<p>Near by, on the southern shore of Afognak Island, is the largest
settlement of the “old colonial citizens” in the Territory; three
hundred and thirty of these people are living here in a very picturesque
and substantial village; a large chapel, which is also used as
a school-house, is the distinguishing architectural feature, while a
number of newly-built row-boats for fishermen, on the stocks, in a
miniature shipyard, point to an industry worthy of attention. The
town is spread over a large landed extent, which in many places
between the dwellings is devoted to vegetable gardens. More
land is under cultivation here than all the rest so treated in
Alaska to-day; the crops of potatoes, cabbages, turnips, and garden-salads,
like radishes, etc., seldom fail except in very backward
years. No ploughing<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> is done; the earth prepared for potatoes is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
thrown with spades, picks, and hoes up as small ridges or tumuli,
into the surface of which the seed is planted. A few of those
shaggy little bulls and cows, which we have noticed before at Wood
Island and Kadiak, are also roaming about, and a great many
domestic fowls, such as chickens and ducks, are raised by the
women and children, who take the poultry into the attics or lofts
above their living rooms during the inclemencies of winter.</p>

<p>The desire of the Russians to have beef, milk, and butter, led to
a very general importation of Siberian cattle from Petropaulovsk so
that every post in Alaska, at one time, had at least a pair of these
useful animals to start with. The greatest care was given to them
at first, everywhere; they were especially fostered at Sitka, where
the demand for their flesh and milk was most urgent, but at Kadiak
and the Kenai mission on Cook’s Inlet, the only partial success in
causing an increase to the stock was achieved. Impressed with an
idea that certain sections of the Kadiak region would serve admirably
for sheep-husbandry, a San Francisco merchant-firm shipped a
flock of rams and ewes—one hundred and fifty of them—sheep of
the hardiest breed, to Kolma, a spot not far from St. Paul’s Harbor,
Kadiak. They were in charge of a trained Scotch shepherd; but
while the flock did remarkably well in the summer, yet most of
them perished during the following winter, not from exposure nor
want of food, but the long-continued and frequent intervals when
the sheep are obliged to be shut up tightly from the fury of wintry
gales laden with sleet and rain and snow, causes their wool to
“sweat” and fall from the skin in large patches, producing an
emaciation and debility which the animal seldom fully recovers
from. Also, the general dampness everywhere under foot during the
summer season in many good grazing sections of Alaska, is such
as to cause an abnormal increase of the hoofs, so that the horny toes
turn and grow upward, destroying the peace and comfort of a
sheep and literally confine its movements and destroy its thrifty
life.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>Since these little villages of Kadiak, Leesnoi, Yealova, and Afognak
embrace within their limits a large majority of the sixteen
or seventeen hundred Creoles who are residents and natives of
Alaska, it may be interesting if a sketch be given of the physical
and mental characteristics which distinguish them broadly from the
aboriginal types. The original Creole was the offspring of a Russian
father and an Aleutian or Kaniag mother. He inherited the
strong thickset frame and bushy, curly beard and brown hair of
his father; in many cases his eyes were as blue (and his hair sometimes
red), his skin as white, and his bearing just as good as was
his Russian progenitors’. The aggressive energy, however, of the
sire seldom was transmitted, the Creole being indolent and very pacific
in disposition. If this original Creole, in his time and turn,
married a full-blooded Aleutian or Kaniag girl, then the offspring
would show a marked dominance of the mother’s race—indeed, the
child would be as much like other Aleutian babies as they are related
in looks among themselves; but if this original Creole marries
an original Creole girl, sired like himself, then we have a type
which cannot be distinguished at all from the full-blooded Slavonian,
only much less demonstrative, alert, and pugnacious. Most
of these old colonial citizens of this district of Kadiak are therefore
full-blooded Russian quadroons and octoroons, and in every physical
aspect are as much like Russians as if of pure origin. Those
early Creoles, male and female, who mated, as they matured, with
the native males and females, in so doing caused all their offspring,
long ago, to revert to the savage types, and we cannot distinguish
them to-day.</p>

<p>Some of the Creole girls and women whom we observe in these
settlements are exceedingly handsome, modest, and the only fault
we can find with them is their absolute speechlessness—they cannot
be induced to chat with us, though they seem to enjoy our
presence. Most of them live in scrupulously clean houses, the
floors scrubbed and sanded like a well holystoned ship’s deck,
walls papered and decorated with pictures of saints and other pious
subjects; old Russian furniture, chairs, settees, bureaus, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>clocks of our own make; the bright, omnipresent “samovar” in
which the boiling water for tea is never allowed to get cool; little
curtains over the small windows, and big curtains puckered around
the beds—everything is usually clean, tidy, and quiet within the
Creole’s home.</p>

<p>The wants of the Creole are very few outside of what the country
in which he lives affords him. He manages to so deal in sea-otter,
and fox and bear skins as to get from the trader’s store what tea,
sugar, flour, and cloth are required for his family. Beyond this
exertion and that displayed in his gardening he rests wholly at
peace with himself and all the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The Kaniags or Kadiakers, who are the natives of this island
and contiguous islands, are in much greater numbers, and are to
be found everywhere here in small hamlets that nestle in the deep
fiörds and bays of Kadiak. They resemble the Aleutes so closely in
outward form and characteristics that the full description given
in a following chapter of those people will cover the whole ground
of this inquiry, only let it be remembered that the Kaniag is a
trifle taller than his Aleutian cousin, has a fairer skin, a somewhat
broader face, and is considerably more muscular. Like the Aleutes,
he has small feet and hands, small black eyes set in deep sockets,
little or no beard, and an abundance of coarse, straight, black hair,
which he cuts off roughly just above his shoulders; he has a trifle
more beard and a better mustache, but this is a very fine distinction.
He is lighter-hearted, freer, and more jovial, but has less
patience during seasons of privation or epidemic disease.</p>

<p>When the Kaniags gather together they are exceedingly talkative,
abounding in jokes, in the recitation of funny legends, and
stories of every imaginable nature associated with their simple
lives. As they paddle their bidarkas and bidarrahs in making long
journeys, they enliven the labor by continuous songs, snatches
from church tunes, or lively airs taught them by the Russians and
later by our soldiers and traders. They are in every respect much
more susceptible of emotional impulses than are the Aleutes. This
greater sociability is well exhibited by the invariable erection, in
every settlement, of a “kashima,” or public dance and work-house,
or, in fact, a town-hall as we have it:—the Aleutes have nothing of
the sort. They pass a good deal of their time on the land, traversing
mountain trails in quest of bears, wolves, foxes, the land-otter,
and the marmot, or “yeavrashkie,” which is made into that famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
skin coat called the “parkie” all over this Alaskan country outside
of the Sitkan archipelago.</p>

<p>As these natives exist to-day there are only eighteen hundred,
a few more or less, of them, which is an immense shrinkage from
the Russian enumeration of six thousand five hundred made by
actual count of Baranov. They seem to be declining even now,
year by year, even as the Koloshians of the Sitkan region do, so
that the native population of the Kadiak district, if decreased<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> in
the next two decades as it has in the last, will hardly have a living
representative. No one can well avoid a train of fast-crowding
thought when he stops in contemplation of sickness and death as
it appears and is treated in savage settlements—the only medical
counsel that they ever have is their own individual instinct. Ignorant
as they are of the simplest anatomical details of their structure,
it is not surprising that they should surrender to disorders and
disease with that remarkable passive apathy which is so distinctive
of the sick everywhere in such communities.</p>

<p>Indians, and these Aleutes and Kaniags, as they grow up, have
no parental supervision whatever as to details of diet, of warm or
cool clothing, or of any of those many attentions which our children
receive from their parents. For the first ten or twelve years of
their lives they literally run wild, and are semi-naked or wholly so,
both male and female;<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> this is their condition, then, at all seasons
of the year. Exposed as they are, in their manner of living, to
draughts, to insufficient covering, and damp, cold nooks for slumber,
in which the air reeks with odors too vile for the power of
language to express, naturally they lay a foundation, at the very
outset of their existence, for pulmonic troubles in all the varied
degrees of that dread disease. Consumption is, therefore, the
simple and broad term for that single ailment which alone destroys
the greatest number of these people, every season, in Alaska; all
the natives, the Eskimo, the Aleut, the Kaniag, and the Indians
suffer from it alike, and they all exhibit that same stolid indifference
to its stealthy but fatal advancement—no extra care, no attempt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
shelter, to protect or to ward off in the slightest manner this
trouble, until the very moment of supreme dissolution calls in a
shaman and the sorrowing relatives.</p>

<p>After lung diseases, the next destroying factor of greatest power
is embodied in the virulence of scrofulous affections, which take
the form of malignant ulcers that eat into the vitals and slough
away the walls of the large arteries. This most loathsome blood-poisoning
renders a few settlements entirely leprous, especially so
to our startled eyes when we visit them. And in this regard it
is hard to find a village in the whole Alaskan boundary where at
least one or more of the families therein has not got upon some one
of its members the singularly prominent scars that attest this disease.
Often a comely young girl or man will, in turning suddenly,
reveal under the jaws or on the neck and throat, a disgusting,
livid eruption which a scrofulous ancestry has cursed the youth
with. Since most of this complaint is on the surface, as it were,
we naturally would look for some care on the part of the afflicted
native, even if for no other end than self-contentment and the ready
alleviation of this cutaneous misery; but we will look in vain, the
patient never gives it. On the contrary, it is utterly neglected, and
by reason of the filthy habit of these people, it is immensely aggravated
and made infinitely more violent. In regard to consumption
this apathy on the part of the victim is not, in contrast, so very
remarkable, since it is more concealed and not near so disagreeable
both to the native and his associates.</p>

<p>Though consumption and scrofula are the two great indigenous
sources of disease and death among the natives, yet there is still a
list—quite a long one—of other ills, such as paralysis, inflammatory
rheumatism and peritonitis, fits, and an abrupt ending of life
in the middle-aged, called most graphically “general debility.” As
might be inferred from the method and exigencies of aboriginal
life in Alaska, these natives do not survive to any great age; rarely,
indeed, will an authenticated case of the full limit of sixty years
be recorded or observed—an overwhelming majority of them are
old at thirty-five and forty. When a man or a woman in a settlement
rounds the fiftieth year of his or her life, a noted example of
the tribe is afforded; but should this age be attained, and the man
then be free from rheumatic troubles or the death-grasp of scrofulous
or pulmonic disease, he is sure to be afflicted with injured and
defective vision, if not totally blind; the glint of snow and the intensely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
smoky interiors of every style of native dwelling so affect
the eyes of these people that those organs of sight, in the middle-aged,
are seldom without signs of decay—showing some one of the
various stages of granular ophthalmia, as a rule.</p>

<p>Snow-blindness can be remedied and its pain abated by the use
of peculiar goggles, which the savages know well how to make and
use, but the greater evil of smoke-poison to the optic nerve is not
obviated at all by any action on their part, though it would be easy
so to do. They actually seem determined to live on so as to live as
wretchedly in the future as they have in the past.</p>

<p>Another singular characteristic of these Alaskan savages is the
fact that none of the many tribes have any medicine whatever; nor
have they any knowledge, so far as we can find out, of any medicinal
herb or mineral, and this again is the most extraordinary item
of it all. Every less or great indisposition is treated by a universal
resort to the sweat-bath; this is the sole specific, and this
is the only relief, except when the shaman is called in to worry
the last hours of the unhappy patient to death, or, perhaps, in rare
cases, to prolong his wretched existence for a longer period, by
stimulating an undue or extra nervous tension, which then causes,
at times, the usually languid and resigned sufferer to rally, as it
were, before the flame flickers out. Truly these people are predestinarians;
they are wonderful in their patience when suffering long
and acutely, as they lie stretched out or squatted in their gloomy,
noisome hovels.</p>

<p>All the traders, and every vessel that sails in Alaskan waters,
have medicine-chests, and to their credit be it said that, as far as
they can, they do everything in their power to aid the natives when
sick; but the aborigines have not the right idea of taking physic,
since they appreciate nothing but forcible treatment—large doses of
something that acts immediately, or nothing at all. For instance, if
the trader gives an Indian a dose of Epsom-salts, the amount given
must be at least four or five times as much as would do for himself,
or there will be no effect on the patient whatever. Consequently,
the simplest remedies known are the only ones which the white
man dare give to these people, and they have, as a matter of
course, very little power to relieve them. During the last six or
seven years a violent form of typhoid-pneumonia has been wasting
whole settlements on the Kadiak and Aleutian coasts; the Creoles
and the natives alike yield at once to the disease, making scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
an effort to save themselves. The traders everywhere became
seriously alarmed, as the force of sea-otter hunters was rapidly
decreasing, and exerted themselves to their utmost in staying the
epidemic, which seemed to be carried from one village to the other
in vessels and by canoes. But the only medicines which can be
used in the safe and successful treatment of this complaint were
regarded as unworthy of notice by the suffering natives, who, not
feeling immediately relieved after taking them, would then totally
ignore their further use.</p>

<p>Bad enough are the indigenous ills of the savages in Alaska.
They were, however, nothing to the horrors which followed the importation
of small-pox by the Russians in 1838-39. This terrible
scourge swept like wildfire up from its initial point at Sitka, over
the whole length of the Alaskan mainland and island coast, until it
faded out in the far north where it had nothing to prey upon. It
actually carried in its grim grasp one-half of the whole population
then living in that large area to an abrupt and violent death—several
districts were so afflicted that not a soul escaped—every
human being was exterminated; it was exceedingly fatal and virulent
in the Sitkan archipelago. We, knowing the filth and exposure
of the lives of these people, can readily understand how they
fell down and were crushed under the march of this disease.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> As
might be supposed the Russians lost no time in thoroughly vaccinating
the survivors; and they have been faithfully followed, in
this duty, by our own sailors and traders who now live in the country.</p>

<p>Another imported evil, the measles, is almost as deadly up here
among the natives as small-pox. While it is a simple trouble arousing
no especial anxiety with us, yet in this climate, together with
the careless methods of life, it assumes a black form and becomes
malignant and fatal. The last extended attack took place principally
in the villages of the Kadiak district in the winter of 1874-75,
where it so alarmed and impressed the sojourning members of
an Icelandic Commission as to shake their desire to emigrate to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
that region—at least, when they returned to their country, they
were never heard from in favor of Alaska.</p>

<p>A very natural question arises in this connection as to whether
or no the savages of Alaska will ever increase in numbers or diminish
to actual extermination as time advances. It appears very plain,
however, that the inhabitants of the Aleutian chain, the Peninsula,
and Cook’s Inlet are nearly as numerous to-day as they have been
ever since the small-pox decimation of 1838-39. But all authorities
agree in declaring that these people have never regained their
numerical force represented in the settlement prior to the advent
of the scourge which depopulated them. As to the Eskimo of
the Bering Sea coasts and the Koloshians of the Sitkan region, it
seems well established, from what we can learn, that they have regained
their former strength in part, and were they only provident
they might live by hundreds where they now exist in tens. Indifferent,
wholly indifferent when living, they are as apathetic when
they face death.</p>

<p>After reading the quaint yet strong narrative of the ferocity
and strength of the Kaniags which Shellikov<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> has given us, it is
hard, indeed, to realize that bold pioneer’s feeling as we now look
in upon the steep slopes of Three Saints Bay, where, at the head of
it, within the sweep of a sand-spit, he erected the first permanent
white habitation ever planted on Kadiak with the aid of the one
hundred and fifty or sixty Russians who formed his company.
Here, to-day, we see a cluster of sod-walled barraboras and two
small, frame trading-houses, in which live one hundred and ninety
of the descendants of those hardy savages who terrified and nearly
annihilated the party of Shellikov one hundred years ago in this
very spot. Nothing else is left, for Baranov in 1796 removed the
post itself to the present site of Kadiak village. As we scan the
settlement of Three Saints we notice that the most prominent object
is the rough-hewn walls and thatched roof of an old Greek
chapel, in front of which is a rude trestle; from the upper frame of
this a bell hangs. Now a stooping figure emerges from the church
door; he seizes the clapper, or bell tongue, with both hands and
swings it vigorously. Promptly the villagers emerge from their huts;
trotting and shambling in single file, they all troop into the chapel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
Meanwhile the dusky sub-deacon still tolls and chimes away long
after every inhabitant has been gathered in. These men and
women who, with bowed heads and fervent crossings, bend and
kneel as they enter that place of worship, are the children of the
“blood-thirsty and implacable” Kaniags of whom Shellikov gave so
vivid a picture to the Empress of all the Russias just a century ago.</p>

<p>They are hunting sea-otters, however, just as they did then,
and living in precisely the same manner, save the variations of outward
demeanor and intercourse due to the teachings of the Greek
Church. But if you go among them and strive to have them tell
you of the heroic battle made by their ancestors on the Oogak
“kekour,” you will be rewarded by either a stupid stare of vacancy
or a muttered “Bogue ezniet” (God knows)!</p>

<p>The deep recess of Eagle Harbor, which lies between this
point of earliest Russian occupation and Kadiak village, affords the
location of another large native village, and its region is called the
best grazing ground in all Alaska. On the surf-beaten islets at the
mouth of the inlet a great many sea-lions are always found, and
thus yield to these hunters of Orlova a rich return in hides and
sinews so essential for the construction of the “bidarka.” A few
families of Creoles also reside here, who attend to a small herd of
cattle, keep fowls, and generally look after their commissions as
middlemen in the sea-otter revenues.</p>

<p>From the earliest colonial time to the present the little village
of Karlook, on the north side of the island, has been the busiest
spot in the country. Here is a salmon-fishing settlement right on
the coast at the mouth of a small river, where from the ancient date
of Russian occupation there has been a salt house and packing establishment,
in which the salt and dried fish used throughout the
entire Alaskan region was annually secured and prepared. To-day
we find two large canning establishments set up and sustained by
San Francisco merchants. The run of salmon into this river of
Karlook at the height of the season is so great that it interferes
with the free movement of canoes in crossing the stream; while the
fishermen of long experience in such matters say that twenty thousand
barrels of the red-meated flesh could be easily secured and packed
away at Karlook every summer and autumn. This salmon,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
abundant here, is much smaller in average size than is the one common
in Cook’s Inlet—it does not average ten pounds in weight.
But the rich red color of its flesh is an object of the canner, who
soon finds out what public taste prefers.</p>

<p>The rough, rocky islands of Trinity, which constitute the extreme
southern limit of the Kadiak influence, are the chosen resort
of sea-lions and many of the rare sea-otter. Their capture lures
a few hardy natives to live in close juxtaposition to the favored
haunts of these much-prized animals, and they have a most extended
hunting range, reaching far away down to the westward and southward
as low as that remarkable barren island of Ookamok, where
the celebrated “Botany Bay,” of the old Russian régime, was established.
That lonely, isolated, desolate spot was the point where
the old-time criminals who were guilty of murder, arson, and other
capital offences, were always shipped, and left largely to their own
devices for a livelihood. They were literally entombed alive on this
islet, where nothing but moss and lichens and scant sphagnum
could exist upon the rough, rocky surfaces, where the soil was
barely appreciable—elsewhere there was none. But, strange to
say, upon this island great numbers of that lively little ground
squirrel, Parry’s marmot, were found, and still continue to be
found, which were characterized then as now by a peculiar bluish
ground-tint to their fur. This color is most popular and the one
so highly prized in those universal coats or cloaks used by the
natives, and called “parkies” by them.</p>

<p>Therefore the convicts were obliged, in order to get food of
their liking and many small luxuries, to diligently hunt these little
animals, which they did, not only for this reason alone, but in self-defence
to kill time as well.</p>

<p>In 1870 the descendants of the original convicts, and survivors
of recent transportation by Russian order, learned in some way
or other that they might lead a free life; so they then actually
removed <em>en masse</em> in two large skin bidarrahs, loaded to the
gunwales, and made in safety that long sea-voyage which intervenes
between Ookamok and Kadiak Island. They had about one
chance in a hundred of getting over the route alive, for the least of
those chronic gales and storms that prevail here would have swept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
them to the bottom of the ocean had it arisen in the time of
their passage.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>A great expanse of tide-troubled and wind-tossed water is bound
between the northern coast of Kadiak and the volcanic ridges of
the mainland opposite. The Straits of Shellikov are fair to see on
the chart, but the mariner who has once sailed into them, lured
there by the false promise of a sheltered passage, never fails to
avoid the track afterward—he gladly makes the open detour of the
broad Pacific. That same precipitous mountain range which we
have gazed upon as it rose in sullen grandeur from the waters of
Cook’s Inlet, still fronts us, just as boldly, as it sweeps down the
entire three hundred miles of the peninsula, forming the southern
coast of that land. The sombre green and blue timber-cloak, so
characteristic of its northern range, is here replaced by the russet-grays
and brownish-yellows of that sphagnum and moss which
now supplant the coniferous forests of Cook’s Inlet, giving to the
picture a much richer tone. Several of these peaks in this chain of
mountains thus extended down the south coast of the peninsula are
five and seven thousand feet in altitude, their summits much eroded
and broken. They hold in their lofty solitudes a great many little
glaciers, that, however, never come down to the sea as they habitually
do in the Choogatch and Elias Alps. The feet of these peninsular
mountains are washed by the direct roll of the ocean waves,
which dash into innumerable fiörds and coves, studded with small,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
rocky islets and reefs awash. A beautiful geological demonstration
of the effect which surf-beating waves of the ocean have made
upon these mountains ages ago, is shown by the plainly evident lines
traced on their flanks fully one thousand feet above the present
level of the tide; and again, another terrace is sculptured in parallel
relief just above it, some five hundred feet higher—a silent,
but conclusive showing of the truth that the entire Aleutian chain
has been lifted out, at two successive periods, and up from the sea.</p>

<p>This range of the peninsula is in itself quite peculiar from the
others which we have hitherto noticed thus far. It differs from
their physiognomy in one respect—the mountains and ridges themselves
are interrupted in one continuity down the line of their
extension by abrupt depressions. These passes, as they appear to
be, are not so in fact, but are either low or elevated marshy plains,
which extend clear across the peninsula; they create an impression
in the mind of the observer that at a not very remote period, geologically
speaking, the peaks of this peninsula range were then
islands, and the marshy portages, now elevated, were the bottoms
of the straits then between them. The natives are continually
going to and fro between the waters of Bering Sea and the
Pacific Ocean over these areas of swampy level, engaged in hunting
reindeer, bear, or in friendly intercourse with the settlements.
The most signal mountain groups on the peninsula are those of
Morshovie, of Belcovsky, and the Pavlosk volcanic cluster—all joined
by low, wet isthmian swales. The Shoomagin volcano of Veniaminov
is also a noteworthy peak. The peninsula is almost bisected
between Moller and Zakharov Bays, where the natives cross from
water to water in a half-day’s portage, and again at Pavlov Harbor.
All these isolated or nearly detached mountain sections have a
striking resemblance in every respect to the first large island,
Oonimak, that is separated from the mainland by the narrow and
unnavigable Krenitzin Straits.</p>

<p>The Bering Sea coast line of the great Alaskan Peninsula presents
a most radical contrast to that of the Pacific—the unbroken,
rocky abruptness and roughness there is here suddenly transformed
right at the very turn in the Straits of Krenitzin, to low, sandy
reaches and slightly elevated moorland tundra, which cover a wide
interval between the mountains and the waters of Bristol Bay and
Bering Sea. The huge masses of lava, of breccia and conglomerate
tufa, that everywhere rear their black-ebony shoulders above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
the Pacific surf, disappear entirely and suddenly here. At Oogashik,
where we find a small settlement of Aleutes from Oonalashka,
hunting walrus and sea-lions, reindeer and bears, the first rocks
of granite and quartz-porphyries appear, every evidence of that
character to the westward being purely and essentially igneous.</p>

<p>Belcovsky is the metropolis of the Alaskan Peninsula. It is the
chief settlement of the sea-otter hunters, and the seat of the greatest
rivalry and traffic in that fur-trade, based wholly upon the costly
skins of the “bobear,”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and which constitutes the only traffic
worthy of mention in which the inhabitants of the entire Aleutian
and Kadiak districts can engage. Here we observe from our anchorage
a little town perched upon the summit of a bluff and
clinging to the flanks of a precipitous mountain that looms up behind
it, usually so wreathed in fog that its summit is seldom seen.
Some two hundred and sixty or seventy Aleutian sea-otter hunters
and their families are living here in an oddly contrasted hamlet
of frame houses and earthen barraboras; the freshly painted red
roof and yellow walls of a large, new church, in the tower of which
a pleasing chime of bells (but rudely struck, however), arrests the
ear and the eye as the most attractive single object within the limits
of the place.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The rival traders have run up their flags very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
smartly on the poles that are erected before their doors as we swing
to anchor in the offing, and a great bustle is evident among the
inhabitants when our boat pulls away for the landing, which is a
sheltered surf-eddy right under the blackest and most forbidding
of bluffs. Two rival trading-firms have each erected a landing
warehouse for the reception of their stores upon the rocky beach
where we step ashore. The ascent to the village above is steep,
but over a sloping slide of mossy earth and rocks. A clear, brawling
brook runs down through the town, and we cross it by a little
foot-bridge on our way. We observe cord-wood piled upon the
beach, which the traders have brought from Kadiak, and several
heaps of coal that had been brought up as ballast from Vancouver’s
Island. This fuel is regularly sold to the natives here, who have
none, unless it be a stray stick of drift-wood or the “chicksa”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
vines, which the women gather on the hill-sides.</p>

<p>Sea-otter hunting is the sole industry and topic of conversation,
for within a radius of fifty miles from the site of Belcovsky fully
one-half of the entire Alaskan catch of these valuable peltries is secured.
Were they not hopelessly improvident, shiftless and extravagant,
they would be a really wealthy community; but the notoriety
of the debauches here has become a by-word and a reproach over
the whole region between Cook’s Inlet and Attoo. Every dollar of
their surplus earnings is squandered in orgies, stimulated by the
vile “quass” or beer which they make. They dress, however, in
suits of every-day clothing, such as we wear ourselves, when lounging
about the village, and their women wear cloth garments and
hats cut after a fashion not very remote in San Francisco.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Village of Aleutian Sea-otter Hunters, on the South Shore of the Alaskan Peninsula. Viewed from the Schooner’s Anchorage</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The neatness of the villages which we have just visited at Kadiak
and Cook’s Inlet has no counterpart in Belcovsky, where, in spite of
its much greater trade and wealth, the filth and neglect everywhere
manifested among the barraboras and their interiors, are in harsh
and disagreeable contrast, while the taciturn, swelled heads of the
inmates speak volumes for the strength of that carousal during the
night prior to your arrival. A small frame house is pointed out
as the school, where it seems that those natives actually sustain a
teacher and send a large percentage of their children. It declares
that these people are not vicious at heart, though they cannot resist
intemperance. They read and write, however, principally in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>Aleutian dialect, using an alphabet prepared for their race by the
Greek Catholic missionaries in 1810-25. But, while the large capture
of sea-otters and consequent flow of the traders’ money and
supplies into this settlement brings these people greater wealth than
that showered elsewhere, yet the real physical misery of those
natives of Belcovsky proves the truth and points the moral of a
very old saying which declares that riches alone do not bring contentment
to the human mind, be it ever so high or ever so low.</p>

<p>A strong south wind is springing up, and you are told by
the skipper that you must get aboard as quickly as possible, for
it is sure destruction to his vessel if she lies long at anchor in the
offing, since the sunken rocks and open roadstead are dangerous.
The little schooner is rapidly put under way, “beating out” in the
freshening gale and headed for Oonga, which is the next settlement
in importance, about fifty miles east. Sailing-vessels never come
into Belcovsky, except those of rival traders, because it is the most
risky port that the mariner has to make in all these waters of Alaska.</p>

<p>Before leaving the sea-otter emporium it is well to call attention
to the fact that at a small indentation of this same peninsula,
twenty-nine miles to the northward, is a settlement made up entirely
of the poor relatives of these Belcovsky people, some forty or
fifty souls, who, however, take a great pride in their superior health
and morality. They have a little chapel, and enjoy much better
opportunities for hunting bear and reindeer. These animals, the
reindeer leading, always followed by the bears, come down at regular
intervals in large herds from a great moorland to the northeast,
travelling on a well-beaten “road” or track, which leads clear
to the westernmost end of the peninsula, where those bovine road-makers
plunge into and cross the narrow Krenitzin Straits to renew
their land march and scatter all over the rugged and extended
tundra and mountain sides of Oonimak Island.</p>

<p>With a line of dissipation and general misery which the rich
commerce of Belcovsky causes in that settlement, we ought not to
fail to include the Protassov or Morserovie village which is located
on the far end of the peninsula—the extreme west end, where a much
smaller community exists, though equally opulent and just as dissolute.
Here is a settlement of nearly a hundred natives, who have
an annual average income of about $1,000 to each family. Yet, in
spite of this small fortune in such a region, when visited by an
agent of the Government in 1880, they shocked him by their aspect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
of abject physical misery and that excessive debauchery which had
stamped them more wretchedly than it had even their cousins of
Belcovsky. These people, in addition to their fine natural advantages
of position for hunting sea-otters, enjoy a location in close
juxtaposition to walrus-banks and sea-lion spits and islands elsewhere
on the Bering shore, where they find these pinnipeds in great
numbers at certain seasons of the year. The flesh, skins, blubber,
and sinews are both articles of essential use and of luxury to them.
Also, the same reindeer and brown-bear road, which we have just
noticed, passes close by the village, so that those desiderata of food-supply
and trade are very accessible.</p>

<p>Near by the village, less than half a mile, as if planned especially
by a merciful providence, there are a number of hot sulphur-springs
which would afford the diseased and sickly natives infinite
relief, if they could only be induced to make the necessary exertion
to go to them and bathe therein. Yet this officer of the Government
declares that not one of them could be induced by him to try
the efficacy of the healing waters—“It was too far to walk!”</p>

<p>When our little vessel comes to anchor in Delarov Harbor, Oonga
Island, of the Shoomagin group, we see a flag flying from the summit
of a grassy knoll which caps an irregular but bluffy headland. The
village lies directly over, and under the shelter of that ridge, and it
opens quickly on our view as we pull around the point and land with
our dingy in a deeply indented cove upon a smooth sand and pebbly
beach. The town is just above, in its full extent, but it is a thickly
clustered mass of fourteen frame houses, twenty or twenty-one barrabkies,
and the ever-present church. It does not make near as
much of a spread as does Belcovsky, although it is quite as large.
This is the chief codfishing rendezvous for the white fishermen who
annually come up to the Shoomagin banks from San Francisco in
six or seven small schooners. The location and surroundings of
the little hamlet are exceedingly picturesque, but, unfortunately,
though in a somewhat less disagreeable extent, the people here are
also given over to those Belcovsky orgies, inasmuch as they, too, are
great and successful otter-hunters, and have an income of over six
hundred dollars for each family, which wealth seems to demoralize
far more than it comforts their existence.</p>

<p>The strong southerly and southeast winds that prevail here
during the summer season are the most severe, and, strange to
say, they are the ones which are the coldest and the chilliest—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
north wind is always warmer! These south winds bring to Oonga
its foggiest weather, its heaviest rains, and raise such a ground
swell in the village harbor that the craft therein are often compelled
to go to sea for safety, and it always drives the fishermen from the
banks outside. Those cod-banks are best, off the southerly range of
the islands, and hence, when a southeaster blows, the schooners are
on a most dangerous lee-shore. They seldom ever take the risks
of riding out such a gale. Old skippers who have fished for
forty years on the Grand Banks and “Georges,” for the Gloucester
and Boston markets, declare that the fury of the sea and wind is
greater off the Shoomagins in a southeaster than anything of the
kind experienced on the Atlantic. These wild gales become
stronger, loaded with sleet and snow, as winter approaches, so
that by the middle or end of November, until next April, all sailing-craft
are practically driven from the fishing grounds.</p>

<p>The same method of catching cod is employed here as practised
by our Gloucester men, in only one respect, however: the long,
buoyed lines are not set out and regularly under-run, but instead,
small boats and dories, with two men in each, are put off from the
schooners, and fish with hand-lines, using what is known as “11-inch”
and “12-inch” hooks. Halibut, and “squid,” or cuttle-fish,
make the best bait. A good, smart man, if he is fortunate, will haul
up four hundred codfish in a day’s steady labor, but this is an extraordinary
streak of luck. An average of three hundred every fair
day is one that gives the highest satisfaction. These fish are taken
on board of the schooner, salted, and not touched again until the
cargo is broken for re-drying and curing at several points chosen
for that purpose in California. At first our people were disposed
to hire the natives up here to do this hand-line fishing, and they
did so; but a patient trial has demonstrated the fact that it pays
to employ our own men instead, even at greatly advanced wages.
The Aleutes are docile, and do exceedingly well in spurts, but they
do not like to work in steady, well-sustained periods of any great
length at a time.</p>

<p>Were it not for the intense physical discomfort of the rapidly
recurring fog, sleet, and rain-laden gales, Oonga would undoubtedly
be a site well chosen for a neat New England fishing village.
Many of those white men now employed up there in the cod-fishery
declare that they would bring their wives and children into the
country, to permanently settle, if they thought that they could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
happy under the conditions of climate which prevail. But they
argue that where they themselves cannot peacefully exist the year
round, it would be idle to suppose that a civilized settlement could
be well established. We will find, however, quite a number of
genial, sociable fellows, men of our race, who are well educated,
and who have had excellent opportunities, and who to-day are
roaming here, there, and everywhere in Alaska, hunting, fishing,
and trading, or prospecting. They appear to be entirely happy,
not a bit cynical, and never express the slightest desire to return
with us to the world which they have left behind them voluntarily.
Alaska to them is a perfect Mecca of peace, and they have no desire
to see it changed. They unite usually in saying that their
wants are few, easily supplied, and they scarcely remember what
care was—it does not trouble them now.</p>

<p>The cod-fishermen do not make their working headquarters in
this village, but across, over the bay on Popov Islet, at a spot which
is called Pirate Cove. They are not annoyed by idle villagers there,
and are also somewhat nearer to the fishing-resorts which are just
outside. They are most likely not far from that spot where Bering
landed, August 30, 1741, to bury one of his seamen named Shoomagin,
and to refill his water-casks. The exact locality, or even the
precise islet of the many that form this Shoomagin group, on
which the then sick and sadly demoralized explorer and his crew
interred the remains of their dead comrade, will never be satisfactorily
established; the cross of wood set up was immediately
pulled down, after his departure, by the natives, who were then
decidedly hostile, and who eyed him and his vessel with unaffected
dislike and apprehension.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> When the <em>St. Peter</em>, six days later,
hauled off from those islands and turned her prow for Kamchatka,
perhaps that gloomy, timid Dane commanding her may have had
an astral premonition of the wreck of this vessel, which soon followed—and
his own death too, in a self-made sand grave beneath
the black shadows of the bluffs at “Kommandor”—this may have
caused him to earn that reproach which has been so lavishly laid
upon his conduct of a most remarkable and disastrous voyage.</p>

<p>The Shoomagins are all bold and bluffy, with high uplands and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
lofty ridges; on Oonga the most elevated summits are to be seen.
Bare of timber, but covered with sphagnum and mosses and
clumps of dwarfed crab-apples and willows, they stand as rock-ribbed
break-waters against the full sweep of the mighty uninterrupted
roll of a vast ocean. The surf that dashes foaming and
booming upon their firm foundations is of unrivalled force, and
fear-inspiring.</p>

<p>Oonga Island has also been the base of a very extended and
thorough attempt to develop a large vein of coal which is found
cropping out on the face of a bluff in a small inlet of its north
shore. The oldest coal-mine in the region of Alaska is located in
Cook’s Inlet near its mouth, at a spot still indicated on maps as
Coal Harbor. Here the Russians, eager to be able to obtain fuel
for the use of their steam-vessels, began, in 1852, a most active and
systematic series of mining operations; they brought machinery
and ran it by steam-power; experienced German miners were
engaged to superintend and direct a large force of Muscovitic
laborers sent up from Sitka. In 1857 the work had been so energetically
pushed that shafts had been sunk, and a drift run into
the vein for a distance of one thousand seven hundred feet; during
this period, and three following years, two thousand seven hundred
tons of coal were mined, the value of which was forty-six thousand
rubles, but the result was a net loss. The thickness of the
vein was found to vary from nine to twelve feet, and its extent
was practically unlimited. But the Russians found out then, as
our people at Oonga did afterward, that this Alaskan lignite was
utterly unfit for use in the furnaces of the steamers—that it was so
highly charged with sulphur as to burn like a flash and eat out,
fuse and warp the grate-bars—even melting down the smoke-stacks!
Steam-vessels now bring their own coal with them from
San Francisco, Puget Sound or Nanaimo, or have it sent up from
there by sailing-tenders to depots previously designated.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>As we leave the sheltering bluffs of Oonga, our course seems to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
be laid directly south; so much so, that for once we express our
surprise to the skipper, who, feeling sure that he understands our
dread of losing time in reaching Oonalashka, spreads out his chart
and calls us to the table. A moment’s inspection shows the wisdom
of the roundabout course, for a forest of rough, rocky islets studs
the ocean directly to the west and many to the south. To sail
through the intricate passages of the Chernaboors and the reefs of
Saanak would be to invite certain destruction. Therefore, as we
make a long detour to clear the path of our progress from all danger,
we will give the reader some interesting facts relative to the
chase of the sea-otter, which is the sole object of those natives who
hunt in this district.</p>

it is very doubtful whether there are sixty head in the whole region. Every
season it is the habit of traders and others to send upon steamers as they go, a
few head of beef-steers, which are turned out at Sitka, Kadiak, and Oonalashka
to fatten during the summer, and then are slaughtered when winter ensues.

<p><a id="Footnote_58" href="#FNanchor_58" class="label">[58]</a> The true reason for this hegira of the convicts is a most amusing one. It
is as follows: Shortly after the transfer, in 1869, General Thomas made an extended
inspection of the Alaskan posts on a steamer detailed for that work.
He was accompanied by a certain representative of a Protestant Board of Missions.
The vessel accidentally ran across Ookamok Island when making her
way to the westward from Kadiak and touched there, where, ignorant of the
fact that the people were convicts and their descendants, moved by their pitiful
tales of privation, a large amount of ship’s stores were landed upon the
beach to satisfy the “suffering” natives: they ate, drank, and were merry, and
lived sumptuously for several months afterward. But an end to these good
things came at last; the reaction in the settlement was terrible. So, urged by
its pangs, the penal colony determined to pack up and move to the nearest
point possible, where, when living, they could again meet, and often too, their
kind benefactors! Hence that startling journey to find those generous Americans.
Lately, however, the traders at Kadiak have taken many of these people
back to Ookamok, where they begged to be allowed to go and end their
lives. This is the most desolate island, perhaps, in all the range of that vast
Aleutian archipelago.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Little does my lady think, as she contemplates the rich shimmer
of the ebony sea-otter trimming to her new seal-skin sacque, that
the quest of the former has engaged thousands of men during the
last century in exhaustive deeds of hazardous peril and extreme daring,
and does to-day—that the possession of the sea-otter’s coat
calls for more venturesome labor and inclement exposure on the
part of the hunter than is put forth in the chase of any other fur-bearing
or economic animal known to savage or civilized man. No
wonder that it is costly; what abundant reason that it should be
rare!</p>

<p>The rugged, storm-beaten resorts of the sea-otter, its wariness
and cunning, and the almost incredible fortitude and patience, skill
and bravery, of its semi-civilized captor, have so impressed the
writer that he feels constrained to rearrange his notes and touch up
his field-sketches made upon the subject-matter of this chapter several
years ago, while cruising in Alaskan waters, so that he may give
to the readers of this work the first full or fair idea of the topic ever
put into type and engraving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>Feodor Altasov, with a band of Russian Cossacks<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and Tartar
“promishlyniks,” were the pioneers of civilized exploration in Eastern
Siberia, and finally arrived at the head of the great Kamchatkan
Peninsula, toward the end of the seventeenth century. Here they
found, first of all their race, the rare, and to them the exceedingly
valuable, fur of the sea-otter. The animal bearing this pelage then
was abundant on that coast, and not prized above the seals and sea-lions
by the natives who displayed their peltries to the ardent Russians,
and who in barter asked little or nothing extra from the white
men in return. The feverish eagerness of the Slavonians, quickly
displayed, to secure these choice skins, so excited the natives as to
result very soon in the practical extirpation of the “kahlan,” as they
termed it, from the entire region of the Kamschadales. The greedy
fur-hunters then rifled graves and stripped the living of every scrap
of the precious object of their search, and, for the time being,
searched in vain for other haunts of the otter.</p>

<p>Along by the close of 1743, the survivors of Bering’s second voyage
of exploration and Tscherikov brought back to Petropaulovsk an
enormous number of skins which they had secured on the Aleutian
and Commander Islands, until then unknown to the Kamchatkans
or the Russians. In spite of the rude appliances and scanty resources
at the command of these eager men, they fitted out rude
wooden shallops and boldly pushed themselves over dark and tempestuous
seas to the unknown and rumored resorts of the sea-otter.
In this manner and by this impulse the discovery of the Aleutian
Islands and the mainland of Alaska was fully determined, between
1745 and 1763. In this enterprise some twenty-five or thirty different
individuals and companies, with quite a fleet of small vessels and
hundreds of men, were engaged; and so thorough and energetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
were they in their search and stimulated capture of the coveted
animal, that, along by the period of 1772-74, the catch of this unhappy
beast had dwindled down from thousands and tens of thousands
at first, to hundreds and tens of hundreds at last. When
the Russian traders opened up the Aleutian Islands they found the
natives commonly wearing sea-otter cloaks, which they willingly
parted with at first for trifles, not placing any especial value upon
the otter, as they did upon the bodies of the hair-seal and sea-lion,
the flesh and skins of which were vastly more palatable to them
and serviceable. But the fierce competition and raised bidding of
the greedy traders soon fired the savages into hot and incessant
hunting. During the first decade or two of pursuit the numbers
of these animals taken all along the Aleutian chain and down the
entire northwest coast as far as Oregon, were so great that they
appear fabulous in comparison with the exhibit made now.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The result of this warfare upon sea-otters, with ten hunters
then where there is one to-day, was not long delayed. Everywhere
throughout the whole coast-line frequented by them, a rapid and
startling diminution set in; so much so, that it soon became difficult
to get from places where a thousand were easily taken, as
many as twenty-five or thirty. When the region known as Alaska
came into our possession, the Russians were taking between four
and five hundred sea-otters annually from the Aleutian Islands and
South of the Peninsula and Kadiak, with perhaps one hundred and
fifty more from Cook’s Inlet, Yakootat, and the Sitkan district, the
Hudson Bay traders and others getting some two hundred more
from the coasts of Queen Charlotte’s and Vancouver’s Islands, and
Gray’s Harbor, Washington Territory.</p>

<p>Now during the last year, instead of less than seven hundred
skins taken as above specified, our traders have secured more than
four thousand. This immense difference is not due to the fact of
a proportionate increase of sea-otters—that is not evident—but it
is due to the keen competition of our people, who have reanimated
the organization anew of old-fashioned hunting-parties, after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
style of Baranov’s bateaux. As matters are now conducted, the
hunting-parties do not let the sea-otter have a day’s rest during the
whole year: parties relieve each other in orderly, steady succession,
and a continual warfare is maintained. Stimulated by our people,
this persistence is rendered still more deadly to the kahlan by the
use of rifles of our best make, which, in the hands of the young
and ambitious natives, in spite of the warnings of their old sires,
must result in the virtual extermination of that marine beast.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>This is the more important because all the world’s supply comes
from the North Pacific and Bering Sea, and upon its continuance
between four thousand and five thousand semi-civilized natives of
Alaska depend absolutely and wholly for the means by which they
are enabled to live beyond simple barbarism; its chase and the
proceeds of its capture furnish the only employment offered by
their country, and the revenue by which they can feed and clothe
themselves as they do, and, by so doing, appear to all intents and
purposes much superior to their Indian neighbors of Southeastern
Alaska, or their Eskimo cousins of Bering Sea.</p>

<p>The sea-otter, like the fur-seal, is another striking illustration
of an animal long known and highly prized in the commercial
world, yet respecting the life and habits of which nothing definite
has been ascertained or published. The reason for this is obvious,
for, save the natives who hunt them, no one properly qualified to
write has ever had an opportunity of observing the <em>Enhydra</em> so as
to study it in a state of nature, inasmuch as of all the shy, sensitive
beasts upon the capture of which man sets any value whatever,
this creature is the most keenly on the alert and difficult to obtain;
and, also, like the fur-seal, it possesses, to us, the enhancing value<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
and charm of being principally confined in its geographical distribution
to our own shores of the Northwest. A truthful account of
the strange, vigilant life of the sea-otter, and the hardships and the
perils of its human hunters, would surpass, if we could give it all,
the novelty and the interest of a most weird and attractive work of
fiction.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p1310_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p1310_ill.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">The Kahlan or Sea-otter.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The sea-otter is widely removed from close relationship to our
common land-otter. Unlike this latter example, it seldom visits the
shore, and then only when the weather is abnormally stormy at sea.
Instead of being a fish-eater, like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lutra canadensis</i>, it feeds almost
wholly upon clams, crabs, mussels, and echinoderms, or “sea-urchins,”
as might be inferred from its peculiar flat molars of dentition.
It is, when adult, an animal that will measure from three
and a half to four and a half feet in length from nose to root of its
short, stumpy tail. The general contour of the body is strongly
suggestive of the beaver, but the globose shape and savage expression
of the creature’s head are peculiar to it alone. The small,
black, snaky eyes gleam with the most wild and vindictive light
when the owner is startled; the skin lies over its body in loose
folds, so that when taken hold of in lifting the carcass out of the
water, it is slack and draws up like the elastic hide on the nape
of a young dog. This pelt, when removed in skinning, is cut only
at the posteriors, and the body is drawn forth, turning the skin
inside out, and in that shape it is partially stretched, air-dried, and
is so lengthened by this process that it gives the erroneous impression
of having been taken from an animal the frame of which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
at least six feet in length, with the proportionate girth and shape
of a mink or weasel.</p>

<p>There is no sexual dissimilarity in color or size, and both male
and female manifest the same intense shyness and aversion to man,
coupled with the greatest solicitude for their young, which they
bring into existence at all seasons of the year, for the natives capture
young pups in every calendar month. As the hunters never
have found the mothers and their offspring on the rocks or beaches,
they affirm that the birth of a sea-otter takes place on the numerous
floating kelp-beds which cover large areas of the ocean south of
the Aleutian chain and off the entire expanse of the northwest
coast. Here, literally “rocked in the cradle of the deep,” the young
kahlan is brought forth and speedily inured to the fury of fierce
winds and combing seas. Upon these algoid rafts the Aleutes often
surprise them sporting one with the other, for they are said to be
very playful, and one old hunter told the writer that he had watched
a sea-otter for half an hour as it lay upon its back in the rollers
and tossed a bit of sea-weed up into the air from paw to paw, apparently
taking great delight in catching it before it fell into the
water.</p>

<p>The sea-otter mother clasps her young to her breast between
her fore-paws, and stretches herself at full length on her back in the
ocean when she desires to sleep, and she suckles it also in this position.
The pup cannot live without its mother, though frequent
attempts have been made by hunters to raise them, for the little
animals are very often captured alive and wholly uninjured;
but, like some other animals, they seem to be so deeply imbued
with fear or dislike of man that they invariably die of self-imposed
starvation. The enhydra is not polygamous, and it is seldom, indeed,
that the natives, when out in search of it, ever see more than
one animal at a time. The flesh is very unpalatable, highly charged
with a rank taste and odor. A single pup is born, as the rule, about
fifteen inches in length and provided with a natal coat of coarse,
brownish, grizzled hair and fur, the head and nape being rather
brindled, and the nose and cheeks whitish-gray, with the roots of
the hair everywhere much darker next to the skin. From this poor
condition of fur at birth the otter gradually improves as it grows
older, shading darker, finer, thicker, and longer by the time they
are two years of age. Then they rapidly pass into prime skins of
the most lustrous softness and ebony shimmering, though the creature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
is not full-grown until it has passed its fourth season. The
rufous-white nose and mustache of the pup are not changed in the
pelage of the adult, but remain constant through life. The whiskers
are short, white, and fine. So much for the biology of the
sea-otter. Now we turn to the still more interesting one of its
captors.</p>

<p>The typical hunter is an Aleutian Islander or a native of Kadiak.
He is not a large man—rather below our standard—say five feet
five or six inches in stature. There are notable exceptions to this
rule, for some of them are over six feet, while others are veritable
dwarfs—resemble gnomes more than anybody else. He wears the
peculiar expression of a Japanese more than any other. His
hair is long, coarse, and black; face is broad; high, prominent
cheek bones, with an insignificant flattened nose; the eyes are
small, black, and set wide in his head under faintly marked eyebrows,
just a faint suggestion of Mongolian obliquity; the lips are
full, the mouth large, and the lower jaw square and prognathous;
the ears are small, likewise his feet and hands; his skin in youth is
often quite fair, with a faint flush in the cheeks, but soon weathers
into a yellowish-brown that again seams into deep flabby wrinkles
with middle and old age. He has a full, even set of good teeth,
while his body, as might be inferred from his habit of living so
much of his life in the cramped “bidarka”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> or skin boat, is well
developed in the chest and arms, but decidedly sprung at the knees,
and he is slightly unsteady in his pigeon-toed gait.</p>

<p>The mate of this hunter was when young a very good-looking
young woman, who never could honestly be called handsome, yet
she was then and is now very far from being hideous or repulsive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
She partakes, somewhat mellowed down, of the same characteristics
which we have just sketched in the face and form of her husband.
As they live to-day, they are married and sustain this relation, sheltered
in their own hut or “barrabkie.” They have long, long ago
ceased to dress themselves in skins, and now appear in store clothes
and cotton gowns, retaining, however, their characteristic water-proof
garment known as the “<em>kamlayka</em>,” and the odd boots known
as “<em>tarbosars</em>,” in which they are always enveloped in wet weather,
or whenever they venture out to sea in their bidarka. They dress
themselves up on Sundays, when at home, in boots and shoes and
stockings of San Francisco make. He wears a conventional
“beaver” or plug hat often, and she affects a gay worsted hood,
although, on account of the steady persistence of high winds, he
prefers a smart marine-band cap, such as our soldiers on fatigue-duty
wear. He is, however, inclined to be quite sober, not giving
much attention to display or color, as is the habit of semi-civilized
people everywhere else; but he does lavish the greatest care and
labor over the decoration of his bidarka, and calls upon his wife to
ornament the seams of his water-repellant kamlayka and tarbosars
with the gayest embroidery, and tufts of bright hair and feathers,
and lines of cunning goose-quill work.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kahgoon, however, is a true woman. She naturally desires
all the bright ribbons and cheap jewellery which the artful trader
exhibits to her longing eyes in his store, that stands so near and so
handy to her barrabkie, and her means only limit the purchase
which she makes of these prized desiderata. She dresses her hair
in braids, as a rule, and twists them up behind. She seldom wears
a bonnet or hat, but has a handkerchief, generally of cotton, sometimes
silken, always tied over her head, and when she goes, as she
often does, out to call on a neighboring spinster or madam, or to
the store, she throws a small woollen shawl over head and shoulders,
holding it drawn together under her chin by one hand. As
we have intimated, she dresses principally in cotton fabrics, with
skirts, overskirts, white stockings, etc.; but when she was a girl,
and much more than that, she usually went, with her legs and feet
bare, into the teeth of biting winds and over frosty water and
wood-paths.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">(<em>The characteristic dwelling of Aleutes and Kadiakers.</em>)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The domestic life of this hunter and his wife is all bound up
within the shelter of their “barrabkie.” This hut or house of the
Aleutian hunter is half under ground, or, in other words, it is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
excavation on the village site of a piece of earth ten or fifteen feet
square, three or four feet deep, which is laid back up and over upon
a wooden frame or whalebone joisting, which is securely built up
within and above this excavation, so that a rafter-ceiling is made
about six feet in the clear from the earthen floor. A wall of peaty
sod is piled up around outside, two and three feet thick. The native
architect enters this dwelling through a little hall patched on
to that leeward side from the winds prevalent in the vicinity. The
door is low, even for Kahgoon, and he stoops as he opens and
closes it. If he has been a successful hunter, he will have the floor
laid with boards secured from the trader; but if he has been unlucky,
then nothing more to stand upon than the earth is afforded.
This barrabkie is divided into two rooms, not wholly shut out one
from the other, by a half-partition of mats, timber, or some hanging
curtains, which conceal the bedroom or “spalniah” from the direct
gaze of the living and cook-room. They are very fond of comfortable
beds, having adopted the feather-ticks of the Russians. Soap
is an expensive luxury, so Kahgoon’s wife is economical of its use
for washing in her laundry; and, though she may desire to spread
over her sleeping couch the counterpane and fluted shams of our
own choice, she has nothing better than a colored quilt which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
traders bring up here especially to meet this demand. A small
deal-table, two or three empty cracker-boxes from the store, and a
rude bench or two constitute all the furniture, while a little cast-iron
stove, recently introduced, stands in one corner, and the heating and
cooking is created and performed thereon. The table-ware of a
hunter’s wife and the household utensils do not require much room
or a large cupboard for their reception. A few large white crockery
cups, plates, and saucers, with gaudy red and blue designs, and
several pewter spoons, will be found in sufficient quantity to entertain
with during seasons of festivity. She manifests a marked dislike
to tin dishes, probably due to the fact that it is necessary to
take care of this ware, or it rusts out. Then, above all the strange
odors which arise here in this close, hot little room, we easily detect
the smell of kerosene, and, sure enough, it is the oil which is
burned in the lamp.</p>

<p>Such a barrabkie built and furnished in this style and occupied
by Kahgoon, his wife, two or three children, and a relative or so, is
a warm and a thoroughly comfortable shelter to him and his, as long
as he keeps it in good repair. It is true that the air seems to us,
as we enter, oppressively close, and, in case of sickness, is positively
foul; yet on the whole the Alaskan is very comfortable. He
never stores up much food against the morrow—the sea and its
piscine booty is too near at hand. Whatever he may keep over he
does not have in a cellar, but hangs it up outside of his door on an
elevated trestle which he calls a “laabas,” beyond the reach of the
village dogs, while there is no thought of theft from the hands of his
neighbors. He lives chiefly upon fresh fish—cod, halibut, salmon
and other varieties, which he secures the year round as they rotate
in the sea and streams. He varies that diet according to the success
of his hunting, by buying at the store tea, sugar, hard-bread,
crackers, flour and divers canned fruits or vegetables. Nature
sends him in season the flesh and eggs of sea-fowl, geese, ducks,
and a few land birds like willow-grouse.</p>

<p>In this fashion the sea-otter hunter appears to us as we view him
now; his children come, grow up, and branch out, to repeat his life
and doing, as they show themselves capable of living by their own
exertions as hunters and fishermen. He is a peaceful, affectionate,
and thoroughly undemonstrative parent, a kind husband, and he
imposes no burden upon his wife that he does not fully share, unless
he becomes a drunkard, when, in that event, a sad change is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
made in the man. He gets drunk, and his wife too, by taking
sugar, flour, and dried-apples, rice or hops, if he can get them, in
certain proportions, puts them into a barrel or cask, with water,
bungs it up and waits for fermentation to do its work. Before it has
worked entirely clear he draws off a thick, sour liquid which intoxicates
him most effectually—he beats his spouse and runs her
and children from the house, smashes things, and for weeks afterward
the barrabkie is desolate and open as the result of such orgies.
If he continues, his health is shattered, he rapidly fails as a hunter,
and he suffers the pangs of poverty with his family. It is said
upon good authority that the brewing of this liquor was taught to
these people by the earliest Russian arrivals in their country, who
made it as an anti-scorbutic; but it certainly has not proved to be
a blessing in disguise, for it has brought upon them nearly all the
misery that they are capable of understanding.</p>

<p>In concluding this brief introduction to the life of the otter-hunter,
we may fitly call attention to the fact that Kahgoon and his
family are devout members of the Greek Catholic Church, as are
all of his people, without a single exception, between Attoo and
Kadiak Islands—nearly five thousand souls to-day, living in scattered
hamlets all along between.</p>

<p>The subtle acumen displayed by the sea-otter in the selection of
its habitat can only be fully appreciated by him who has visited the
chosen land, reefs, and water of its resort. It is a region so gloomy,
so pitilessly beaten by wind and waves, by sleet, rain and persistent
fog, that the good Bishop Veniaminov, when he first came among
the natives of the Aleutian Islands, ordered the curriculum of hell
to be omitted from the church breviary, saying, as he did so, that
these people had enough of it here on this earth! The fury of
hurricane gales, the vagaries of swift and intricate currents in and
out of the passages, the eccentricities of the barometer, the blackness
of the fog enveloping all in its dark, damp shroud, so alarm
and discomfit the white man that he willingly gives up the entire
chase of the sea-otter to that brown-skinned Aleut, who alone
seems to be so constituted as to dare and wrestle with these obstacles
through descent from his hardy ancestors, who, in turn,
have been centuries before him engaged just as he is to-day.</p>

<p>So we find the sea-otter-hunting of the present, as it was in the
past, entirely confined to the natives, with white traders here and
there vieing in active competition one with the other in bidding for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
the quarry of those dusky captors. The traders erect small frame
dwellings as stores in the midst of the otter-hunting settlements,
places like Oonalashka, Belcovsky, Oonga, and Kadiak villages,
which are the chief resorts of population and this trade in Alaska.
They own and employ small schooners, between thirty and one
hundred tons burthen, in conveying the hunting parties to and
from these hamlets above mentioned as they go to and return from
the sea-otter hunting-grounds of Saanak and the Chernaboor rocks,
where five-sixths of all the sea-otters annually taken in Alaska are
secured. Why these animals should evince so much partiality for
this region between the Straits of Oonimak and the west end of
Kadiak Island is somewhat mysterious, but, nevertheless, it is the
great sea-otter hunting-ground of the country. Saanak Island,
itself, is small, with a coast-circuit of less than eighteen miles.
Spots of sand-beach are found here and there, but the major portion
of the shore is composed of enormous water-worn boulders,
piled up high by the booming surf. The interior is low and rolling,
with a central ridge rising into three hills, the middle one some
eight hundred feet high. There is no timber here, but an abundant
exhibit of grasses, mosses, and sphagnum, with a score of little
fresh-water ponds in which multitudes of ducks and geese are
found every spring and fall. The natives do not live upon the
island, because the making of fires and scattering of food-refuse,
and other numerous objectionable matters connected with their
settlement, alarm the otters and drive them off to parts unknown.
Thus the island is only camped upon by the hunting-squads, and
fires are never made unless the wind is from the southward, since
no sea-otters are ever found to the northward of the ground. The
sufferings—miseries of cold, and even hunger, to which the Aleutes
subject themselves here every winter, going for weeks and weeks
at a time without fires, even for cooking, with the thermometer
below zero in a wild, northerly and westerly gale of wind, is better
imagined than portrayed.</p>

<p>To the southward and westward of Saanak, stretching directly
from it out to sea, eight or ten miles, is a succession of small, submerged
islets, rocky, and bare most of them, at low water, with
numerous reefs and stony shoals, beds of kelp, etc. This scant area
is the chief resort of the kahlan, together with the Chernaboor
Islets, some thirty miles to the eastward, which are identical in
character. The otter rarely lands upon the main island, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
is, when found ashore, surprised just out of the surf-wash on the
reef. The quick hearing and acute smell possessed by this wary
brute are not equalled by any other creatures in the sea or on land.
They will take alarm, and leave instantly from rest in a large section,
over the effect of a small fire as far away as four or five miles
distant to the windward of them. The footstep of man must be
washed from a beach by many tides before its trace ceases to scare
the animal and drive it from landing there, should it approach for
that purpose.</p>

<p>The fashion of capturing the sea-otter is ordered entirely by the
weather. If it be quiet and moderately calm, to calm, such an interval
is employed in “spearing surrounds.” Then, when heavy
weather ensues, to gales, “surf-shooting” is the method; and if a
furious gale has been blowing hard for several days without cessation,
as it lightens up, the hardiest hunters “club” the kahlan.
Let us first follow a spearing party; let us start with the hunters,
and go with them to the death.</p>

<p>Our point of departure is Oonalashka village; the time is an
early June morning. The creaking of the tackle on the little
schooner out in the bay as her sails are being set and her anchor
hoisted, cause a swarm of Aleutes in their bidarkies to start out
from the beach for her deck. They clamber on board and draw
their cockle-shell craft up after them, and these are soon stowed
and lashed tightly to the vessel’s deck-rail and stanchions. The
trader has arranged this trip and start this morning for Saanak, by
beginning to talk it over two weeks ago with these thirty or forty
hunters of the village. He is to carry them down to the favored
otter-resort, leave them there, and return to bring them back in
just three months from the day of their departure this morning.
For this great accommodation the Aleutes interested agreed to give
the trader-skipper a refusal of their entire catch of otter-skins—indeed
many of them have mortgaged their labor heavily in advance
by pre-purchasing at his store, inasmuch as the credit system is
worked among them for all it is worth. They are adepts in driving
a bargain, shrewd and patient. The traders know this now,
to the grievous cost of many of them.</p>

<p>If everything is auspicious, wind and tide the next morning, after
sailing, bring the vessel well upon the ground. The headlands are
made out and noted; the natives slip into their bidarkies as they
are successively dropped over the schooner’s side while she jogs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
along under easy way, until the whole fleet of twenty or thirty craft
is launched. The trader stands by the rail and shakes the hand of
each grimy hunter as he steps down into his kyack, calling him, in
pigeon-Russian, his “loobaiznie droög,” or dear friend, and bids
him a hearty good-by. Then, as the last bidarka drops, the ship
comes about and speeds back to the port which yesterday morning
she cleared from, or she may keep on, before she does so, to
some harbor at Saanak, where she will leave at a preconcerted
rendezvous a supply of flour, sugar, tea, and tobacco for her party.</p>

<p>If the weather be not too foggy, and the sea not very high, the
bidarkies are deployed into a single long line, keeping well abreast,
at intervals of a few hundred feet between. In this manner they
paddle slowly and silently over the water, each man peering sharply
and eagerly into the vista of tumbling water just ahead, ready to
catch the faintest evidence of the presence of an otter, should that
beast ever so slyly present even the tip of its blunt head above
for breath and observation. Suddenly an otter is discovered, apparently
asleep, and instantly the discoverer makes a quiet signal,
which is flashed along the line. Not a word is spoken, not a
paddle splashes, but the vigilant, sensitive creature has taken the
alarm, and has turned on to its chest, and with powerful strokes of
its strong, webbed hind feet, has smote the water like the blades of
a propeller’s screw, and down to depths below and away it speeds,
while the hunter brings his swift bidarka to an abrupt standstill
directly upon the bubbling wake of the otter’s disappearance. He
hoists his paddle high in the air, and holds it there, while the
others whirl themselves over the water into a large circle around
him, varying in size from one-quarter to half a mile in diameter,
according to the number of boats engaged in the chase.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">A fleet of Sea-otter Hunters in the North Pacific, South of Saanak Island: marking the Wake of an Otter at the Moment of its Diving</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The kahlan has gone down—he must come up again soon somewhere
within reach of the vision of that Aleutian circle on the waters
over its head; fifteen or twenty minutes of submergence, at the
most, compel the animal to rise, and instantly as its nose appears
above the surface, the native nearest it detects the movement, raises
a wild shout, and darts in turn toward it; the yell has sent the
otter down again far too quickly for a fair respiration, and that is
what the hunter meant to do, as he takes up his position over the
spot of the animal’s last diving, elevates his paddle, and the circle
is made anew, with this fresh centre of formation. In this method
the otter is continually made to dive and dive again without scarcely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>an instant to fully breathe, for a period, perhaps, of two or even
three hours, until, from interrupted respiration, it finally becomes
so filled with air or gases as to be unable to sink, and then falls at
once an easy victim. During this contest the Aleutes have been
throwing their spears whenever they were anywhere within range
of the kahlan, and the hunter who has stricken the quarry is the
proud and wealthy possessor, beyond all question or dispute.</p>

<p>In this manner the fleet moves on, sometimes very fortunate in
finding the coveted prey; again, whole weeks pass away without a
single surround. The landings at night are made without any
choice or selection, but just as the close of the day urges them to
find the nearest shore. The bidarkies are hauled out above surf-wash,
and carefully inspected; if it is raining or very cold, small
A-tents are pitched, using the paddles and spears for poles and
pegs, into which the natives crowd for sleep and warmth, since they
carry no blankets or bed-clothes whatever, and unless the wind is
right they dare not make a fire, even to prepare the cherished cup
of tea, which they enjoy more than anything else in the world, not
excepting tobacco. After ninety or a hundred days of such employment,
during which time they have been subjected to frequent
peril of life in storm, and fog-lost, they repair to the rendezvous
agreed upon between the trader and themselves, ready and happy
to return for a resting-spell, to their wives, children, and sweethearts
in the village whence we saw them depart. They may have been
so lucky as to have secured forty or fifty otters, each skin worth
to them at least fifty to sixty dollars, and if so, they will have a prolonged
season of festivity at Oonalashka, when they get back. Perhaps
the weather has been so inclement that this party will not
have taken a half-dozen pelts; then gloomy, indeed, will be the
reception at home.</p>

<p>While the “spearing surround” of the Aleutian hunter is orthodoxy,
the practice, now universal, of surf-shooting the otter, is
heterodoxy, and is so styled among these people, but it has only
been in vogue for a short time, and it is primarily due to our
traders, who, in their active struggle to incite the natives to a
greater showing of skins, have loaned and have given, to the young
hunters in especial, the best patterns of rifles. With these firearms
the shores of many of the Aleutian channels, Saanak, and the
Chernaboors, are patrolled during heavy weather, and whenever a
sea-otter’s head is seen in the surf, no matter if a thousand yards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
out, the expert, patient marksman shoots seldom in vain, and if he
does miss the mark, he has a speedy chance to try again, for the
great distance, and thunderous roar of the breakers prevent the
kahlan from hearing or taking alarm in any way until it is hit by
the rifle-bullet: nine times out of ten, when the otter is thus
struck, it is in the head, which is all that the creature usually
exposes. Of course such a shot is instantly fatal, so that the hunter
has reason to sit himself down with a long landing-gaff and wait
serenely for the surf to gradually heave the prized carcass within
his ready reach.</p>

<p>Last, but most exciting and recklessly venturesome of all human
endeavor in the chase of a wild animal is the plan of “clubbing.”
You must pause with me for a brief interval on Saanak to understand,
even imperfectly, the full hazard of this enterprise. We cannot
walk, for the wind blows too hard—note the heavy seas foaming,
chasing and swiftly rolling by, one after the other—hear the
keen whistle of the gale as it literally tears the crests of the breakers
into tatters, and skurries on in sheets of fleecy vapor, whirring
and whizzing away into the darkness of that frightful storm which
has been raging in this tremendous fashion, coming from the westward,
during the last three or four days without a moment’s cessation.
Look at those two Aleutes under the shelter of that high
bluff by the beach. Do you see them launch a bidarka, seat themselves
within and lash their kamlaykas firmly over the rims to the
man-holes? And now observe them boldly strike out beyond the
protection of that cliff and plunge into the very vortex of the fearful
sea, and scudding, like an arrow from the bow, before the wind,
they disappear almost like a flash and a dream in our eyes!</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp86" id="p1421_ill" style="max-width: 44.9375em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">ALEUTES CLUBBING SEA OTTERS</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">During a furious gale on the Chernaboor Rocks</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Yes, it looks to you like suicide; but there is this method to
their madness. These men have, by some intuition, arrived at an
understanding that the storm will not last but a few hours longer
at the most, and they know that some ten or twenty or even thirty
miles away, directly to the leeward from where they pushed off, lies
a series of islets, and rocks awash, out upon which the long-continued
fury of this gale has driven a number of sea-otters that
have been so sorely annoyed by the battle of the elements as to
crawl there above the wash of the surf, and, burying their globose
heads in heaps of sea-weed to avoid the pelting of the
wind, are sleeping and resting in great physical peace until the
weather shall change: then they will at once revive and plunge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>back into the ocean without the least delay. So our two hunters,
perhaps the only two souls among the fifty or sixty now camped
on Saanak, who are brave enough, have resolved to scud down on
the tail of this howling gale, run in between the breakers to the
leeward of this rocky islet ahead of them, and sneak from that
direction over the land and across to the windward coast, so as to
silently and surely creep up and on to the kelp-bedded victims, when,
in the fury of the storm, the fast falling footsteps of the hunter are
not heard by the active yet somnolent animal ere a deadly whack of
his short club falls upon its unconscious head. The noise of such a
tempest is far greater than that made by the stealthy movements of
these venturesome natives, who, plying their heavy, wooden bludgeons,
despatch the animals one after another without alarming the
whole number. In this way, two Aleutian brothers are known to
have slain seventy-eight otters in less than one hour!</p>

<p>If these hardy men, when they pushed off from Saanak in that
gale, had deviated a paddle’s length from their true course for the
islet which they finally struck, after scudding twenty or thirty miles
before the fury of wind and water, they would have been swept on
and out into a vast marine waste and to certain death from exhaustion.
They knew it perfectly when they ventured, yet at no time
could they have seen ahead clearly, or behind them, farther than a
thousand yards! Still, if they waited for the storm to abate, then
the otters would all be back in the water ere they could even reach
the scene. By doing what we have just seen them do they fairly
challenge our admiration for their exhibit of nerve and adroit calculation,
under the most trying of all natural obstruction, for the
successful issue of their venture.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the writer calls attention to a strange habit of
the Aleutian otter-hunters of Attoo, who live on the extreme westernmost
island of the grand Alaskan archipelago. Here the kahlan
is captured in small nets,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> which are spread out over the floating
kelp-beds or “otter-rafts,” the natives withdrawing and watching
from the bluffs. The otters come out to sleep or rest or sport on
these places, get entangled in the meshes, and seem to make little
or no effort to escape, being paralyzed, as it were, by fear. Thus
they fall an easy prey into the hands of the captors, who say that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
they have caught as many as six at one time in one of these nets,
and that they frequently get three. The natives also watch for surf-holes
or caves awash below the bluffs: and, when one is found to
which a sea-otter is in the habit of going, they set this net by
spreading it over the entrance, and usually capture the creature,
sooner or later.</p>

<p>No injury whatever is done to these frail nets by the sea-otters,
strong animals as they are; only stray sea-lions and hair-seals
destroy them. There is no driving an otter out upon land if
it is surprised on the beach by man between itself and the water;
it will make for the sea with the utmost fearlessness, with gleaming
eyes, bared teeth and bristling hair, not paying the slightest regard
to the hunter. The Attoo and Atkah Aleutes have never been
known to hunt sea-otters without nets, while the people of Oonalashka,
and those eastward of them, have never been known to use
such gear. Salt-water and kelp appear to act as disinfectants for
the meshes, so that the smell of them does not repel or alarm the
shy, suspicious animal.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_64" href="#FNanchor_64" class="label">[64]</a> The Cossacks who came with Altasov were rough-looking fellows of
small size, lean and wiry, with large, thin-lipped mouths and very dark skins.
Most of them were the offspring of Creole Russian Tartars and women from
the native tribes of Siberia. They were filthy in their habits. Naturally
cruel, they placed no restraint upon their actions when facing the docile
Aleutes, and indulged in beastly excesses at frequent intervals. The custom
of the Cossack hunters after establishing on an island, was to divide the
command into small parties, each of which was stationed in or close by a
native settlement. The chief or head Aleut was induced by presents to assist
in compelling and urging his people to hunt. When they returned, their
catch was taken and a few trifling presents made, such as beads and tobacco-leaf.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="label">[65]</a> In 1804 Baranov (the Colonial Governor) went from Sitka to the Okotsk
with fifteen thousand sea-otter skins, that were worth as much then as they are
now, viz., fully $1,000,000. Last year the returns from Alaska and the northwest
coast scarcely foot up four thousand skins; but they yielded at least
$200,000 directly to the native hunters, being ten times better pay than
they ever brought under Russian rule to these people.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="label">[66]</a> It is a fact, coincident with the diminution of the sea-otter life under
the pressure of Russian greed, that the population of the Aleutian Islands fell
off at the same time and in the same ratio. The Slavonians regarded the lives
of these people as they did those of dogs, and treated them accordingly. They
impressed and took, under Baranov’s orders, in 1790-1806, and his subordinates,
hunting-parties of five hundred to one thousand picked Aleutes, eleven or
twelve hundred miles to the eastward from their homes at Oonalashka, Oomnak,
Akoon, and Akootan. This terrible sea-journey was made by these
natives in skin “baidars” and bidarkies, traversing one of the wildest and
roughest of coasts. They were used not only for the drudgery of otter-hunting
in Cook’s Inlet and the Sitkan archipelago, but forced to fight the Koloshians
and other savages all the way up and down those inhospitable coasts. That
soon destroyed them—very few ever got back to the Aleutian Islands alive.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="label">[67]</a> The “bidarka” is a light framework of wooden timbers and withes very
tightly lashed together with sinews in the form indicated by my illustrations.
It is covered with untanned sea-lion skins, which are sewed on over it while
they are wet and soft. When the skins dry out they contract, and bind the
frame, and are as taut as the parchment of a well-strung bass-drum. Then
the native smears the whole over with thick seal-oil, which keeps the water
out of the pores of the skin for quite a long period and prevents the slackening
of the taut binding of the little vessel for twenty-four to thirty hours at a
single time. Then the bidarka must be hauled out and allowed to dry off in
the wind, when it again becomes hard and tight. Most of them are made with
two man-holes, some have three, and a great many have but one. The otter-hunters
always go in pairs, or, in other words, use two-holed bidarkies.</p>

<p class="no-indent">After “lying-to” in a fierce southwester for three whole days and
nights, in which time the fury of the gale never abated for an hour,
our captain had so husbanded his resources that, when the weather
moderated, he was able to clap on sail and get under swift headway;
then we quickly left the watery area of our detention and
soon opened up a splendid vista of Oonimak Island, in the early
dawning of a clear June day. This is the largest one of that longextended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
archipelago which stretches as an outreaching arm for
Asia from America; it presents to our delighted gaze a sweep of
richly-colored, rolling uplands, which either slope down gently to
the coast at intervals, or else terminate in chocolate-brown and
reddish cliffs abruptly stopped to face the sea breaking at their
feet. Very high ridges, with summits entirely bare of vegetation,
traverse the centre of the island from east to west, while the towering
snowy cone of Shishaldin and the lower, yet lofty, head of Pogromnia—two
volcanoes—rear themselves over all in turn.</p>

<p>There are a multitude of huge and cloud-compelling mountains
in Alaska, but it is wholly safe to say that Shishaldin is the most
beautiful peak of vast altitude known upon the North American
continent; it rears its perfectly symmetrical apex over eight thousand
feet in sheer height above those breakers which thunder and
incessantly roll against its flanks, as these precipitous slopes fall
into the great Pacific Ocean on the south, and Bering Sea to the
north. A steamy jet of vapor curls up lazily from its extreme
summit, but it has not been eruptive or noisy at any time within
the memory of the Russians. No foothills, that crowd up against
and dwarf the presence of most high mountains, embarrass your
view of Shishaldin; from every point of the compass it presents
the same perfect cone-shape; rising directly from the water and
lowlands of Oonimak, it holds and continues long to charm your
senses with its rare magnificence; the distance of our vessel, ten
or twelve miles away, serves to soften down its lines of numerous
seared and blackened paths of prehistoric lava overflow, so that
they now softly blend their purplish tones into those of the rich-hued
mantle of golden-green mosses and sphagnum which cover
the rolling lower lands.</p>

<p>As we draw into Oonimak Pass—it is the gateway for all sailing
vessels bound to Bering Sea from American ports, we, in closing
up with the land, almost lose sight of Shishaldin, and come into
the shadow of the rougher and less attractive volcano of Pogromnia.
It shows ample evidence of its origin by the streams of blackened
frost-riven basalt and breccia which are ribbed upon its rugged
sides; great masses of eruptive rock and pumice lie here and there
scattered all over the broad-stubbed head of the mountain; tons
and tons of this material have rolled from thence in lavish profusion
and disorder, clear down for miles to the very waters of the
sea and straits, strewing that entire route with huge débris. Seams
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>of snow and ice lacquer, in white, thread the bold black crown of
this, the “booming” or “noisy” volcano of the Russians. It has
not been in action since 1820, when it then threw showers of ashes
and pumice; but those fires in its furnace are only banked, as it
has been smoking in inky brown and black clouds at irregular and
frequent intervals ever since; loud mutterings, deep rumblings
and wide-felt tremors of land and sea are aroused by it constantly.
This Island of Oonimak has been always regarded by the Russians
as the roof of a subterranean smelting furnace with many chimneys
through which telluric forces ascended from the molten masses
beneath. It has been, and is still, the theatre of the greatest
plutonic activity in Alaska. Russian eye-witnesses have described
violent earthquakes here where whole ridges of the interior and
coast have been rent asunder, cleft open, from which torrents of
lava poured and columns of flame and clouds of ashes, steam and
smoke, have risen so as to be viewed and noticed for a circuit of
hundreds of miles around. These manifestations were always
accompanied by violent earthquakes, and tidal-waves which often
submerged adjacent villages on the sea-level, and also whole native
settlements were swept away in mountain floods caused by the
sudden melting of those big banks of ice and snow on such volcanic
summits and their foothills, upon which the hot breccia from
a vomiting crater fell.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>This great island in olden times was the one most densely
populated by the Aleutes. The excesses and terrible outrages of
Russian promishlyniks, followed by the wholesale work of death
wrought by small-pox, have utterly eliminated every human settlement
from the length and breadth of Oonimak, upon which no one
has resided since 1847. Ruins on the north shore show the abandoned
sites of numerous large hamlets; one was over four thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
two hundred feet in its frontage on the beach. The fear and
superstition which those tragedies of early Russian intercourse
produced in the simple minds of the natives, who belonged by
birth to this great island, became at length so potent as to cause
the entire and permanent abandonment of their desolated villages,
which were once so populous and well satisfied.</p>

<p>The craters, and outflow therefrom, on Oonimak have been, from
time immemorial, resorted to by the natives as their store-houses for
sulphur, and that shining obsidian with which they tipped their
bone-spear and arrow-heads; of it, also, they made their primitive
knives, and traded the surplus stock to those Aleutes living elsewhere.
They used the sulphur with dried moss in making fires,
which they started with the fire-stick and by rocky concussions.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Before entering the straits of Oonimak, we had a fine view of the
entire sweep of the Krenitzin group, that presents a succession of
the wildest and most irregular peaks and bluffs, everywhere seeming
to jut up and fall into the sea, without a gentle slope for a
human landing, as they face the Pacific billows dashing so incessantly
upon their basaltic bases; the extreme eastern islet of the
group is Oogamok, and it forms the opposite land from Cape Heethook
on Oonimak, directly across the straits. A swarm of sea-parrots
fly out from its rocky bluffs on the south shore, stirred into
unwonted activity and curiosity by the near approach of our vessel,
while a dozing herd of sea-lions suspiciously stretch their long necks
into the air, smell us, then simultaneously and precipitately plump
themselves into the foaming breakers just below their basking-place
above the surf-wash.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to adequately define or express those varying
impressions which are inspired by a panorama of these Aleutian
Islands, such as unfolds itself to your eye when rapidly sailing along
under their lee on a clear day. The scene is one of rare beauty.
The water is blue and dancing until it strikes in heavy waves upon
the rocky curbing of the islands, dashing up clouds of spray in
white, fleecy masses against the dark-brown and reddish cliff-walls
rising over all. The slopes and the summits of everything on land,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
save the very highest peaks, are clothed in an indescribably rich
green and golden carpet of circumpolar sphagnum; exquisitely-colored
lichens<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> adorn the stony sea-bluffs and precipices inland.
Every minute of the ship’s progress in a free, fair wind shifts the
fascinating scene—a new peak, another bold headland, a narrow
pass, unfolds now between two islets that just before apparently
were solid and as united as one island could be; a steamy jet of
hot-spring vapor rises from a deeper, richer mass of green and gold
than that surrounding it, and a dark-brownish column of smoke
that issues from a lofty, cloud-encircled summit in the distance is
the burning crater of Akootan.</p>

<p>Everything is so open here, is so plain to see, that when you try
to find some points of resemblance to that picture which has challenged
your admiration in the Sitkan archipelago, you find nothing—absolutely
nothing—in common effect. It is, nevertheless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
just as attractive, just as grand; but how different! All is laid
perfectly bare to inspection here—no dense forests and tangled
thickets to conceal the surface of the diversified uplands and mountain
slopes, or to hide the innermost recesses of the deep ravines
and narrow valleys. While there is a vast variation in the islands,
yet there is, to the mind of him who views them for the first time,
the most helpless inability on his part to distinguish or even recognize
them apart when he happens to revisit them. They are seldom
ever clearly defined, being more or less obscured in fog and heavy
rifts of cloud. The top of a headland peeps aloft, sharply outlined,
while all below is lost in the mists and banks of fog that roll
up there from the sea. Then, in remarkable contrast, only a few
miles beyond, the rocks at sea-level and foothills of the next island
will be entirely plain to your sight; while everything above is concealed,
in turn, by a curtain of the same moist and vanishing
misty fog. Fog, fog, fog everywhere, rising and descending with
the force of wind-currents that bear it—now veiling, now revealing
the startling and impressive beauties of this vast sea-girt chain of
the Aleutian archipelago. These majestic blue swells of the great
Pacific join with those cold green waves of that lesser, shallower
ocean of the North in holding with firm embrace the most impressive
range of fire-eaten mountains known to the geographer. This
cordon of smoking, grumbling, quaking hills and peaks, when
once surveyed, leaves an enduring image, grand and superb, on the
retina of that eye which has been so fortunate as to behold it.</p>

<p>As the little schooner bears up to the westward for our port of
Oonalashka, after we have well passed the Straits of Oonimak, we
sail into the shorter, choppy waters of Bering Sea—into its characteristic
light gray-green hue of soundings. The precipitous walls
of Akoon Island, rising like so much Titanic sandstone masonry
everywhere abruptly from the surf, carry a broad green plateau,
that rolls and extends high above the surrounding tide-level.
Here, under their lee, on the north shore, we encounter one of
those large schools of humpback whales<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> which are so common
and so frequently met with in the Aleutian straits and passages.
These animals rise and sink alongside of the vessel, in utter disregard
of its presence; and even volleys and bullets of our breech-loading
rifles rapidly fired into their broad, glistening, gray-black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
backs and sides do not seem to arouse or alarm them in the least.
Down they lazily go, to soon rise again with a sonorous whistle as
they “blow.” A cloud of whale-birds hover over and settle on the
watery area occupied by the feeding whales, ever and anon rising,
to alight again as the cetacean fleet leaves its feathered convoy
tossing behind on the wavelets of the sea.</p>

<p>Our skipper, who has been a whaler in his youth, tells us, with
a quaint air of contempt for what we so much admire, that these
fish-like monsters are of no consequence in the eyes of a wise whaling
captain, for though they are large enough, it is true, yet they
are the wrong breed of whales—they are lean, fighting humpbacks,
which, if struck with a harpoon, will run like an express engine for
fifty miles or more, carrying a boat and crew of our species, either
down in its rapid rush, or else diving in the shoals, over which it
feeds, it rolls the death-dealing iron out or breaks it off on the
bottom.</p>

<p>A stiff head-wind causes the course of the vessel to frequently
lie close in to the shore where the massive bluffs of Akoon and
Akootan rise in grim defiance, and from the shelves and interstices
of which flocks of sea-parrots and little auks fly out in circling
flights of curiosity and inspection around the schooner. As we
watch the lazy motions of the whales, we recall the fact that on the
summits of these bluffs and headlands now before us, the natives of
Oonimak, as well as those to the country born, were in the habit of
standing through long vigils of daily and nightly watch, as they
went whale-fishing long ago after their own primitive fashion.</p>

<p>Nothing fit to eat is, or was, so highly prized by the Aleutes or
Kaniags, as the blubber and gristle of a whale. To secure this
luxury these savages were in the habit of subjecting themselves to
infinite hardship and repeated bitter disappointment. The chase
of the “ahgashitnak”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and the little “akhoaks”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> was the important
business of their lives in times of peace. The native hunter
used, as his sole weapon of destruction, a spear-handle of wood
about six feet in length; to the head of this he lashed a neatly-polished
socket of walrus ivory, in which he inserted a tip of serrated
slate that resembled a gigantic arrow-point, twelve or fourteen
inches long and four or five broad at the barbs, and upon the point
of which he carved his own mark</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>In the months of June and July the whales begin to make their
first inshore visits to the Aleutian bays, where they follow up
schools of herring and shoals of <em>Amphipoda</em>, or sea-fleas, upon
which they love to feed. These bays of Akootan and Akoon were
and are always resorted to more freely by those cetaceans than are
any others in Alaska, and here the hunt is continued as late as
August. When a calm, clear day occurs the natives ascend the
bluffs and locate a school of whales; then the best men launch their
skin-canoes, or bidarkas, and start for the fields. “Two-holed”
bidarkas only are used. The hunter himself sits forward with
nothing but his whale-spear in his grasp; his companion, in the
after hatch, swiftly urges the light boat over the water in obedience
to his order. Carefully looking the whales over, the hunter
finally recognizes that yearling, or the calf, which he wishes to
strike; for it is not his desire to attack an old bull or angry cow-whale.
He calculates to a nice range where the “akhoak” will rise
again from its last point of disappearance, and directs the course
of the bidarka accordingly. If he is fortunate he will be within ten
or twenty feet of the rising calf or yearling, and as it rounds its
glistening back slowly and lazily out from its cover of the wavelets
the Aleut throws his spear with all his physical power, so as to
bury the head of it just under the stubby dorsal fin of that marine
monster; the wooden shaft is at once detached, but the contortions
of the stricken whale only assist to drive and urge the barbed slate-point
deeper and deeper into its vitals. Meanwhile the canoe is
paddled away as alertly as possible, before the plunging flukes of
the tortured animal can destroy it or drown its human occupants.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Natives of Akoon and Akootan killing Hump-back Whales</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As soon as the whale is thus wounded it makes for the open
sea, where “it goes to sleep” for three days, as the natives believe;
then death intervenes, and the gases of decomposition cause its
carcass to float, and, if the waves and currents are favorable, it will
be so drifted as to lodge on a beach at some locality not so very
remote from the place where it was struck by the hunter. The
business of watching for these expected carcasses then became the
great object of everyone’s life in that hunters’ village; dusky
sentinels and pickets were ranged over long intervals of coast-line,
stationed on the brows of the most prominent headlands, where
they commanded an extensive range of watery vision. But the
caprices of wind and tides are such in these highways and byways
of the Aleutian Islands, that on an average not more than one whale
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>in twenty, struck in this manner by native hunters, was ever
secured; nevertheless, that one alone (when cast ashore) amply
repaid the labor and the exposure incurred chiefly by watching day
after day, in storm and fog, from the bluffs of Akoon and Akootan.
The lucky hunter who successfully claimed, by his spear-head
mark, the credit of slaying such a stranded calf or yearling, was
then an object of the highest respect among his fellow-men, and it
was remembered well of him even long after death.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Also, the
greatest expression of respect for the size and ability of a native
village and its people was the statement that it was so populous as
to be able to eat all the meat and blubber of a large whale’s carcass
in a single day!</p>

<p>As we “put about” under the frowning walls at Cape North,
of Akootan, our captain says that the next tack will carry us into
Oonalashka Harbor. Meanwhile, as we stand out into the waters of
Bering Sea, we have a superb vista of the rugged, seared, and
smoking summit of Akootan itself, which rears its hot head high
above the rough, rocky island that bears its name. The beaches
are few and far between, and there is but little land upon this
island to invite a pedestrian, since masses of dark basalt, vesicular
and olivine, are scattered in wild profusion everywhere. Over the
northeast side steamy clouds arise from the path of a hot spring,
which gushes out of the mountain, so hot that meat and fish are
cooked in its scalding flood by the natives. On the very crest, as
it were, of this whale-backed volcano, are two small, deep lakes
that once were the vent-holes of subterranean fires. In olden times
seven settlements, with a population of more than six hundred
Aleutes, lived on the coast of this island, which, with Akoon, was
then the whale-hunter’s paradise. To-day we find it utterly desolate,
inhabited by a poverty-stricken hamlet of sixty-five natives,
who are located on the southwest shore. The able-bodied men of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
this place spend the greater part of their time, however, far away
from home on the sea-otter grounds of Saanak, being carried, like
their brethren of Akoon and Avatanak, to and from that spot by
a trader’s vessel.</p>

<p>Closely joined to them is the village of Akoon, in which fifty-five
or sixty of their countrymen live on the northwest shore, who hunt
and deport themselves as do those of Akootan. The Akoonites,
however, enjoy the satisfaction of being nearer than their neighbors
to that small, rugged islet of Oogamak, which stands in the path,
as it were, of the great Pass of Oonimak; here on the low rocks a
comparatively large number of sea-lions repair, and the little hair-seal
also. For some reason or other, more of these last-named
seals are found here than elsewhere in the entire large extent of this
gigantic island chain. Akoon used to boast of many mighty whalers
among its prehistoric population of five or six hundred natives,
who, in fading away, have left the ruins only of eight settlements
to attest their previous proud existence.</p>

<p>While we have noticed the poverty of the Akootans, yet, as we
contemplate the wretched little village on Avatanak, close by and
facing the straits, we must call this the most abject human settlement,
perhaps, that we shall or can find throughout the archipelago—only
nineteen souls living here in the most abandoned squalor and
apathy, principally upon the sea-castings of the beach and mussels.
Yet this island in olden days was the happy home for a busy little
fishing community which then had three settlements on the banks
of a beautiful stream that empties its clear waters into the sea on
its north side. The most revolting chapter in all the long story of
Russian outrage and oppression of Aleutian natives is devoted to
a recital of the savage brutality of Solovaiyah and Notoorbin, who
lived here during the winter of 1763.</p>

<p>Steam-vessels usually make the jagged headlands and peaks of
Tigalda Island as their first land-fall <em>en route</em> from San Francisco to
Oonalashka and Bering Sea. They then shape their course into
Akootan Straits very easily and safely. The currents and winds,
which always cause a variation of the ship’s course, never carry the
vessel much to the right of Tigalda, or to the left of Avatanak, so
that an experienced Alaskan mariner has but little difficulty—even
though dense fog prevails, which only gives him fitful gleams of
the rude landscape—in recognizing some one of the characteristic
peaks or bluffs of these Krenitzin islands; then, with a known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
point of departure, he can literally feel his way into Oonalashka
Harbor. He almost always has to do so, for seldom indeed does he
enjoy as fair a sweep of these coasts of Avatanak and Tigalda as
that viewed by the author, who scanned this rocky group in a calm,
clear September afternoon of 1876.</p>

<p>To-day, Tigalda is an utterly abandoned island, given over
during the summer to the undisturbed possession of foxes and
those flocks of “tundra” geese which settle on the uplands to breed
and preen in safety. When moulting here, they have the shelter of
several lakes, upon which they swim in mocking security, even if
crafty, lurking Reynard attempts to capture them. Near the
largest lake on this island a settlement once throve. The inhabitants
had control of a mine of red and golden-yellow chalk, which
formed the base of a pigment highly prized by all Aleutes, far
and near, for painting their ancient grass, and wooden hats, and
other work of the same materials. On the north side of this island
is a singular cluster of needle rocks which rise, as twenty-eight
points, abruptly from the sea. On them, in positive security, the
big burgomaster gull breeds, and the eagle-like pinions of this bird
bear thousands of heavy bodies in stately flight over and around
these nesting-places. The shrill, hawk-like screams of those
“chikies” can be heard far out at sea, over the noise of the surf.</p>

<p>Oogalgan rock, which stands up boldly, and defies that fury of
an ocean in the mouth of Oonalga Straits, is another striking headland
which the mariner should be well acquainted with, for in
times of arrival, when fog prevails, it is often the first land-fall
made after leaving California or Oregon, when bound in for Oonalashka.
It is a bleak, tempest-swept islet, presenting to the Pacific
a black, reddish front of abrupt precipitous cliffs, without a
sign of vegetation in the crevices; but, from the inside passages of
Akootan and Oonalga, it exhibits two or three saddle-backed
slopes covered with green mosses and lichens. Flocks of those
comical shovel-billed sea-parrots breed upon it, and skurry in their
rapid, noiseless manner all around.</p>

<p>At last our little schooner “comes about,” to make that “reach”
which is to take us into the peace and quiet of a beautiful harbor,
and, with every sail drawing hard, she fills away, and we glide
swiftly ahead. That richly banded waterfall bluff on our right, and
the striking outline of Kahlecta Point, over the “Bishop” rock
under it, on our left, are eagerly scanned as we dash through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
heavy roll of Akootan Straits and its violent tide-rips, the surf breaking
on the “Bishop” and the point beyond it most grandly. A short
hour, and the rough water is passed. We have entered Captain’s
Harbor, and are “fanning” along over a glassy surface up to our
anchorage off from, but close by, the village of Oonalashka.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>What San Francisco is to California, so is Oonalashka to all
Alaska west of Kadiak. It is the point of all arrivals and all departures
for and from this vast area. It is most fitly chosen, and
beautifully located. From earliest time, an Aleutian legend never
failed in its rendition to the dusky people then living in their
yourts and kazarmies to vividly impress upon the native mind a
full sense of those pleasures of life and hope at Illoolook; not, however,
as expressed so sadly by our own bard, whose inimitable
poem declares that the wolf howled long and dismally from this
lovely shore of Illoolook.</p>

<p>If Campbell had only substituted “Akoon” for “Oonalashka”
in this much-admired verse descriptive of savage desolation, he
would not have marred a famous passage by the slightest error—but,
at Oonalashka, never, never was a wolf ever known to be. In
1830, however, two of these animals got over from Oonimak as far
west as Akoon—on drifting ice-floes, most likely. They were speedily
noticed by the natives, who killed them at once, so Veniaminov
says, for they were cordially hated by the Aleutes, since these
beasts “kill foxes and spoil the traps.”</p>

<p>The panorama of land and water here in summer is an exceedingly
attractive one—in its effect fully as charming as is the lovely
spread of Sitka Sound; but its character is widely opposed. If
we chance to view Oonalashka in clear sunshine during a day in the
summer months, we will recall this picture to our mind’s eye often
with positive pleasure. Here, strung along for half a mile just
back of a curved and pebbly beach, is an irregular row of frame,
single-story cottages, a large Greek church, and a fine parsonage,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>three or four big wooden warehouses with a wharf running well
into the harbor, two or more trading-stores, one of them quite imposing
in its size, and fifty or sixty barraboras—these constitute the
abiding-places of the four hundred residents of Illoolook. They
are placed upon a narrow spit of alluvium that divides the sea from
the waters of a small creek which runs just back of the village
right under these hills that abruptly rise there, to rise again, farther
inland, to higher peaks in turn. A rich, dark, vivid green covers
and clothes the mountain slopes, the valleys, and the hills, even to
the loftiest summits, where only a light patch of glistening snow
is now and then seen relieved thereon by the grayish-brown rocky
shingle. These hills and mountains, rising on every hand above
us from the land-locked shores of Captain’s Harbor, bear no timber
whatsoever, but the mantle of circumpolar sphagnum, interspersed
with grasses and a large flora, makes ample amends for that
deficiency and hide their nakedness completely—in their narrow
defiles and over the bottom-land patches grass grows with tropical
luxuriance, waist-high, with small clumps of stunted willow-bushes
clinging to the banks of little water-courses and rivulets.
This is the only growing timber found anywhere on the
Aleutian chain. It never becomes stouter than the thickness of a
man’s wrist, and the tallest bushes in scattered thickets are never
over six or seven feet high, rapidly dwindling in growth as they ascend
the hillsides.</p>

<p>Especially gratifying is the landscape, thus adorned, to the
senses of any ship-worn traveller, who literally feasts his eyes upon
it. But if he should go ashore and step upon what appeared to
him, from the vessel’s deck, to be a firm greensward, he will find
instead a quaking, tremulous bog, or he will slide over a moss-grown
shingle, painted and concealed by cryptogamic life, where
he fondly anticipated a free and ready path. The thick, dense
carpet of crowberry<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> plants that is spread everywhere over the hillsides,
into which the pedestrian sinks ankle-deep at every step,
makes a stroll very laborious when undertaken at any distance from
the sea-beach.</p>

<p>If a wide survey is accomplished here of Oonalashka Island, the
studies made will give a perfect understanding of every other island<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
to the westward in this great archipelago, which is enveloped during
the major portion of each year in fogs, and swept over by frequent
gales. Such a combination of the elements, with mists and
hidden sea-currents, make it a region dreaded by mariners; yet
there is enough sunshine now and then to make the life of our landsmen
very comfortable, even though they cannot engage in any other
profitable calling than that of sea-otter trading with the natives.</p>

<p>Summers are mild, foggy, and humid. The average temperature
is about 50° Fahrenheit. Winters are also mild, foggy, and humid,
with a slightly colder average of 30°. The thermometer nowhere
in the Aleutian chain ever went much below zero at sea-level.
There is no record even of a consecutive three or four weeks in
winter lower than 3° or 5° above zero. The mercury seldom ever
falls as low as 10°. There is no nice distinction of the four seasons
here. We can notice only two. Winter begins in October and
ends by May 1st to 5th, when summer suddenly asserts herself for
the rest of the year not thus appropriated.</p>

<p>Flurries of snow sometimes fall in August and often in September.
It never stays long on the ground or even on the hilltops
then, and generally melts as fast as it comes, away into December;
but on the highest peaks it is seen all the year round. From
January to May 1st or 5th, as a rule, snow covers everything in a
spotless shroud from two to five feet deep. The high, blustering
wintry gales make this snow intensely disagreeable to us, driving
into and through air-tight crevices, and literally making the inmates
of the village huts prisoners for weeks at a time. The dogs and
sleds so common and characteristic elsewhere in the vast expanse
of Alaska are never seen here. They would be a mere nuisance to
these people, since the rugged inequalities of the Aleutian country
simply prohibit their use.</p>

<p>This is, however, the chosen land for lingering fogs. The foggy
cloudiness of the Aleutian Islands is most remarkable. There are
not a dozen fogless days in the whole year at Oonalashka, though
the sun may be seen half the time. Fifty sunshiny days in the
year is a handsome average. Thunder is never heard, or seldom
ever, while lightning is never seen, although the dark swelling
clouds seem to constantly suggest it; also the northern lights—these
auroral displays are almost unknown, and when seen are very,
very faint.</p>

<p>But the wind—ah, the winds that riot over this range of rocky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
islands! They are always stirring. A perfect calm has never been
recorded at Oonalashka. They are strong and come from all points
of the compass; they are freshest and most violent in October and
November, December, and March. Gales follow each other in quick
succession during these months every year, lasting usually about
three days each.</p>

<p>All sides of Oonalashka Island are deeply indented by bays and
fiörds; but the points on the southern coast are avoided and not well
known. They are not safe to approach on account of reefs and
rocks, awash and sunken, which extend out to sea a long distance,
and upon them the heavy billows of the Pacific Ocean break incessantly,
as well as against the cliff-beaches of this forbidding shore.
But around the northern and eastern margins of the island more
good harbors are located than can be found on all of the other islands
of the Aleutian archipelago put together. They call the bay which
we entered, as we sailed in from Akootan Pass, “Captain’s Harbor.”
It is the same place where the natives first gazed upon a white man
and his ship after the frightful massacres of 1762 and 1763. Here
in 1769 Layvashava, with a crew of those Siberian promishlyniks,
anchored during the whole of one autumn and engaged the astonished
inhabitants in active trade; but it was a guarded and tedious
barter, since the Aleutes had a lively recollection of the terrible
past, so recent and so bloody.</p>

<p>The island of Oonalashka chanced to be the scene of that only
real desperate and fatal blow ever struck by the simple natives of
the Aleutian chain at their Cossack oppressors. By 1761 the
Russians had advanced to the eastward as far as Oonimak, and up
to this time the relations between the natives and the white invaders
had been altogether of an outwardly friendly character, the
former submitting, as a rule, patiently to the demands of the newcomers,
but the Cossack Tartars, encouraged by their easy conquests,
rapidly proceeded from bad to worse, committing outrages
of every kind, so that in 1762 they had reduced the Aleutes to the
verge of absolute slavery, and continued to act in this manner until
the patience and the timidity of the simple race were exhausted. The
arrival of a brutal, domineering, lustful party of over one hundred
and fifty of these Cossack Russians at Chernovsky, on the northwest
coast of this island, in the summer of 1762, under the nominal
command of a Siberian trader named Drooshinnin, proved to be
“the last straw laid upon the camel’s back.” At a given signal the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
despoiled and ravished natives arose in every one of the then populous
Oonalashkan settlements (twenty-four villages), flocked together,
and unitedly fell upon their oppressors. They slaughtered
every man except four, who happened, luckily for them, to have
been absent from their vessels in Chernovsky Harbor, hunting
grouse in the mountains. They were secreted in the recesses of a
hot cave (that is still pointed out in the flanks of Makooshin Mountain),
by the kindness of a charitable native, until they were able
to escape and join the expedition of Solovaiyah, which appeared at
the offing of Oomnak early in the following year. Fired by a
recital of the Drooshinnin slaughter, this fierce Cossack turned his
half-savage comrades, and worse yet, himself, loose upon the unhappy
people of Oonalashka, and literally exterminated every male,
old and young, that he could find, visiting each settlement in swift
rotation of death and desolation. The men and boys fled to the
fastnesses of the interior, followed by many of the women, and
when the inclemencies of winter began to threaten their starvation,
they humbly sued for peace, and became the abject and submissive
vassals of the promishlyniks ever after.</p>

<p>A smoking volcano that rears its ragged crown high above all
the surrounding hills and peaks is Makooshin; it juts, alone and
unsupported, as a bold promontory, five thousand four hundred
and seventy-five feet above, and into the green waters of Bering
Sea. It is the chief point of scenic interest on Oonalashka Island,
and the objective one in particular, if the day be clear, as the
visitor sails up and into the harbor of Illoolook. While it is not
near so majestic in elevation, or perfect of outline, as the Shishaldin
Mountain, yet it is wild and striking. It can be easily ascended
in July and August, when the winds do not blow their hardest, and
when there is the least snow. No one remembers, nor is there any
legend of any disturbance more serious than the shaking of the
earth and loud noises which Makooshin is charged with. In 1818
it made the whole island tremble violently during a period of several
days, emitting, however, nothing but dense columns of smoke,
and fine ashes were sifted lightly everywhere with the winds. A
resounding cannonade that then burst from its bowels sorely alarmed
the people, however, who fled from their little hamlets clustered at
its base.</p>

</figure>

<p>Immediately under the steep slopes and large proportions of this
quiescent volcano is a small settlement of sixty natives, housed in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>those typical Aleutian barraboras, with a small chapel, of course.
Here, in 1880, lived the oldest inhabitant of the Oonalashka parish,
an Aleut who had an undisputed age of eighty-three years. These
simple souls have that same faith in the good behavior of Makooshin
which distinguished the citizens of Herculaneum and Pompeii
with reference to the dangers of Vesuvius. But the most
amusing indignation is expressed by them in speaking of the bad
behavior of an Oomnak crater, just across the straits from them,
which in 1878 broke out into earthquakes, smoke, fire, and mud-showers,
that so frightened the fish all about in these waters as to
literally cause a famine at Makooshin. The finny tribes seem to be
driven off by a trembling of the rocky bottom to the sea.</p>

<p>It was at Makooshin that the first Russians landed under Stepan
Glottov in 1757. These traders in their reports declared that the
natives here then “were very numerous and warlike,” and that they
had a great deal of that peculiar trouble with them which we so
thoroughly understand now in the light of their infamous record.
Certain it is that a more innocent-looking, indolent group of Aleutes
cannot be found in all this region to-day than are these descendants
of the “blood-thirsty savages,” which Glottov saw in council here.
They trap cross-foxes on the flanks of the great mountain which overshadows
their settlement, and do but little else. They are not at all
impressed by the volcano, and cannot understand why we should
walk over a long portage of eight miles from Oonalashka Harbor
just to ascend it: because, they say truly, that the chances are ten
to one against our seeing anything when we shall get up there, inasmuch
as fog will surely shut down over everything. In spite,
however, of their argument we ascended, and they were right. We
could not see a rod beyond our footing in any direction, and had it
not been for their guidance, as the fog continued, we would have
had a very difficult matter in regaining the lowlands at all that
day.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>When Makooshin is seen from Bering Sea, in the early autumn,
the snow rests upon its peculiar form so as to make a most striking
suggestion of its being extended as a huge corpse, with a sheet
thrown over the upper part only of the body. The natives have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
many folk-lore stories and legends which belong to the mountain;
but these yarns are like the ballads of our sailor boys, they run on
forever, ending in the same manner as they began. A hot spring
sends a little rivulet of warm water across our path as we come
down, and we notice that most of the boggy places are tinged with
iron oxides.</p>

<p>In overlooking any of these islands from an interior view of
high altitude, you are impressed by the large number of fresh-water
lakes and ponds that nestle in the valleys, in the uplands, and even
in the depressions on the loftiest summits. One of the prettiest
pools of water which can be imagined is formed by the red, bowl-shaped
walls of an extinct crater that makes the top of Paistrakov
Mountain: this is a very prominent landmark just across the bay
from Oonalashka village, looking west.</p>

<p>A superb survey of Oonalashka Island can be made by the ascent
of Mount Wood, which rears its sharp, syenitic peak two thousand
eight hundred feet behind and right over the village and harbor
of Illoolook. The path to the summit is not difficult, and the
panorama spread out under your eyes well repays the effort. It
gives you a better idea of what a singularly mountainous region the
island is, of the comparative absence of level or bottom-land areas—everything
seems to spring from the surrounding ocean mirror,
to hills—from hills, in turn, to mountains that end in sharp and
rugged peaks. Upon the rocky, frost-riven shingle of these summits
nothing can grow except those tiny polar lichens which we find
existing, clinging to the earth and rocks of the uttermost limits of
the North as far as we have knowledge.</p>

<p>If the fog lifts its gray-blue curtain from the unruffled, clear
surface of Captain’s Harbor, and rolls back and away from the red
and brown head of the cold crater of Paistrakov on the left, and
from the black, jagged outlines of the “Prince” on your right, you
will then have at your feet a picture of surpassing scenic beauty,
both of contour and color, before and under your delighted vision.
The rougher waters of Bering Sea have power no farther inland
than their foaming at the feet of Waterfall Head and the dark bases
of the Prince, for they rapidly fade into a smooth, still peace as the
queer, hook-like sand-spit of Oolachta Harbor is reached, and the
anchorage of Illoolook village is attained; its houses and barraboras
just peep out from the obscuring foothills of the mountain
upon which we stand, and we can faintly discern a delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
fringe of sea-foam along the border of a long-curved beach
in front. Two schooners and a steamer lie motionless upon the
glassy bay, like so many microscopic water insects.</p>

<p>Turning right about and looking south, our eyes fall upon a
radically different landscape—a bewildering, labyrinthian maze of
Oonalashkan mountain peaks and ranges, rising in defiance to all
law and order of position, with that lovely island-studded water
of the head to Captain’s Harbor in the foreground. Ridge after
ridge, summit after summit, fades out one behind the other into
the oblivion of distance, where the suggestion of a continuance to
this same wild interior is vividly made, in spite of wreaths of fog
and lines of snowy sheen, relieved so brightly by that greenish-blue
of the mosses and sphagnum in which they are set. A few pretty
snow-buntings flutter over the rocks to the leeward of our position;
their white, restless forms are the only evidence or indication of
animal life in our rugged vista of an Oonalashkan interior. Yet,
could we see better, we might notice a lurking red fox, and flush a
bevy or two of summer-dressed ptarmigan, feeding as they do on
the crowberries, the sphagnum, willow-buds and insect-life.</p>

<p>While gazing into the endless succession of valleys, and scanning
the varied peaks, a puff of moist wind suddenly strikes our
cheeks—we turn to its direction and behold it bearing in and up
from Bering Sea—a thick and darkening bank of fog which rapidly
envelopes and conceals everything that it meets. It ends our sightseeing,
and peremptorily orders a return to the village below from
which we came.</p>

<p>When we look at the Aleutes we are impressed at once with their
remarkable non-resemblance to the Sitkans. They constantly remind
us of Japanese faces and forms in another costume. The
average Aleut is not a large man; he is below our medium standard—being
about five feet six inches in stature, though, of course,
there are a few exceptions to this rule, when examples will be found
six feet tall, and many that are mere dwarfs. The women are in
turn proportionately smaller. The hair is coarse, straight, and
black; the beard scanty; cheek-bones are broad, high, and very
prominent; the nose very insignificant and almost flattened out at
the bridge—the nostrils thick and fleshy; the eyes very wide-set—very
small, too, with a jet-black pupil and iris; the eyebrows very
faintly marked; the lips are thick; the mouth large; the lower jaw
is very square and prognathous; the ears are small, set close to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
the head, and almost always pierced for brass or silver rings. The
complexion is a light yellowish-brown; in youth it is often fair,
almost white, with a faint blush in the cheeks; in middle age and
to senility the skin always becomes very strongly wrinkled and
seamed, with a leathery harshness. They all have full even sets of
teeth, but never take the least care of them whatever. They have
small, well-shaped hands and feet, but the finger-nails are exceedingly
thin and brittle, bitten off, and never trimmed neatly. They
walk in a clumsy, shambling manner, with none of that lithe,
springy stepping so characteristic of the Rocky Mountain Indians.
When we meet them as we saunter through the settlement, men,
women, and children alike drop their eyes to the ground, and pass
by in stupid humility, or indifference, as the case may be.</p>

<p>As we see these people at Oonalashka, so they are seen in every
respect elsewhere, as they exist between Attoo and Bristol Bay and
the Shoomagin Islands. They spend most of their time, men and
women, in their skin-canoes, hunting the sea-lion and sea-otter—in
codfishing and travelling to and from their favorite salmon-runs
and berrying-grounds. Therefore, they have not enabled a symmetrical
figure to develop—their legs are always sprung at the
knees, some badly bowed, and all are unsteady in walking. While
there is nothing about the countenances of the women or girls
which will warrant the term of handsome, yet they are not so ugly
as the squaws of the Sitkan archipelago. Many of them have very
kindly expressions, and a gleam of true womanly instinct far above
their surroundings.</p>

<p>No people are more amiable or docile than are these natives of
the Aleutian Islands to-day. They are quiet and respectful in their
intercourse with the traders, and are all duly baptized members of
the Greek Catholic Church. A chapel is never absent from their
villages. They hunt sea-otters and trap foxes for their means of
trading for those simple luxuries and necessaries of their life which
they cannot find in their own country. There are no other fur-bearing
animals here, and no other industries whatever in which
they can engage.</p>

<p>As they live here to-day, they are married and sustain very faithfully
the relation of husband and wife. Each family, as a rule, has
its own hut or barrabora. They have long, long ago ceased to dress
in skins; but they still retain and wear the primitive water-proof
coat or “kamlayka” and boots or tarbosars, which are made from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
seal and sea-lion intestines. In the poverty-smitten stations of
Akoon and Avatanak the early bird-skin “parkas” will probably be
most commonly worn; (but it is because these natives are so miserably
poor in furs that they do so). They get from the trader’s store
at every village a full assortment of our own shop-made clothes,
and, on Sunday in especial, many shiny broadcloth suits will be displayed
by the luckier hunters. The women are all attired in cotton
dresses and gowns, made up pretty closely in imitation of the prevailing
fashions among our own people. They wear the boots and
shoes which are regularly brought up from San Francisco. But
whenever they go out fox-trapping, or enter their bidarkas, they
wear the “tarbosar” or water-proof boot of primitive use—the uppers
to it are made from the intestines or the gullets of marine
mammalia, and it is soled with the tough flipper palms of a sea-lion.</p>

<p>They have the same weakness for our conventional high stovepipe
hats which we display; but the prevalence of those boisterous
gales and winds peculiar to these latitudes prevents that use of the
cherished “beaver” that they otherwise would make of it. Instead,
they universally wear low-crowned, leather-peaked caps, to which
they love to add a gay red-ribbon band, suggested most likely
by the recollection which they have of that gorgeous regalia of the
Russian army and naval officers, who were wont to appear in full
dress very often when among them in olden time.</p>

<p>The Aleutian men dress very plainly, young and old alike, little
or no attention being given by them to details of color or ornamentation,
as is the common usage and practice of most semi-civilized
races; but they do lavish a great deal of care and skill in the
decoration of their antique “kamlaykas,” “tarbosars,” and their bidarkas:
the seams of these garments and the boats are frequently
embellished with gay tufts of gaily colored sea-bird feathers and
lines of goose-quill embroidery.</p>

<p>True feminine desire for all the bright ribbons and cheap jewelry
that a trader spreads before her consumes the heart of the
Aleutian woman, especially if she be young and admired by her
people. The women are, therefore, only limited by their means,
when it comes to bedecking themselves with all of these trinkets
and gewgaws of the kind which the artful trader exhibits for that
purpose. They braid their hair up in two queues usually and let
them hang down behind upon their backs. They never wear bonnets,
or hats, for that matter; but as they go to church or from hut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
to hut they tie cotton handkerchiefs over their heads. When hasty
little errands out of doors, or sudden gossiping trips are undertaken,
a shawl is thrown over the woman’s head and held there,
with the gathered ends together, under her chin by one hand. The
shawls are of bright colors, and supply the place of woollen garments,
though ready-made cloaks and dolmans are not uncommon
at those points where the sea-otter-hunting harvest is the best:
her skirts, overskirts, waists, and stockings are all of cotton.</p>

<p>As these people have really but one idea and no variation of occupation,
they all live alike, in the same general manner. The
difference between the families is only that of relative cleanliness
and thrift. The most important and serious business of their
shore-life is that embodied in the construction and repair of their
huts, or barrabkies. If it is well built it makes a warm, dry shelter,
and answers every requirement of a comfortable domicile. An
excavation is made in the earth on the spot selected in the village
site, ten or twelve feet square, and three or four feet deep. A wooden
frame and lining is then put into this sub-cellar, and the excavated
earth is then thrown back against and over it, with an outer wall of
carefully-cut sod and boggy peat, being laid up two and three feet
thick, sloping down to which is a well-thatched roof of grass and
sedge, that abounds everywhere on the sandy margins of the sea-shore.
Some of these huts are made very much larger than this
pattern just defined, having regularly spread wings, like a Maltese
cross, on the floor. The entrance to the barrabkie is usually
through a low doorway that is made to a small annex or storm
hallway, also built of sod and peat. This shields another little
door, which opens into the living-room that the architect steps
down into as he enters. A single window is put at the opposite
end of the room from the door, in which a small glazed sash is
usually employed. The floor is either covered with boards which
the native has purchased from the trader, or else it is the hard-trodden
earth itself, upon which the women strew grass and spread
mats of the same texture.</p>

<p>A diminutive cast-iron stove is now very generally used by the
Aleutes. It commonly stands right in the centre of the room, and
upon it the cooking can be done, instead of being driven to the hallway
fireplace, or “povarnik,” of the olden time, when the smoke then
stifled them from the burning of that fat of seals, fish and birds,
which was used very largely for fuel Therefore, they were obliged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
to stew and broil on a special fireplace constructed outside of the
living-room. A great many old-style “peechka” stoves of the Russians
are still in use, but no new ones are being made any more,
since the introduction of our little iron stoves. This living-room
of the hut is usually curtained or partitioned into two sections, one
of which is the bedchamber, or “spalniah.” They have a great
variety of beds and bedsteads, or bunks rather. They are proud
of a well-stuffed couch of feathers, and take more real, solid comfort
in sleeping thereon than in anything else that transpires of an
enjoyable nature in their lives. The dealers sell a series of the
most gaudily printed spreads for these beds, and sometimes you
will be much surprised to see a white counterpane and fluted pillow-shams
spread over an Aleutian couch. Those beds are always
raised well up from the floor, and sometimes a curtain is specially
hung around them—a borrowed Russian idea, unquestionably. A
rude table, two or three empty cracker-boxes from the trader’s
store for chairs, and a rough bench or two, is about all the furniture
ever seen in a barrabkie. The table-ware and household utensils
do not require a large cupboard for their reception. Cups and
saucers of white crockery, highly decorated in flaring blue and red
floral designs, plates to match, a few pewter teaspoons, will usually
be found in sufficient quantity for the daily use of the family; and
these are loaned out to a neighbor also, on occasions of festivity,
when an entire circle of chosen friends join under the roof of some
one barrabora in tea-drinking and “praznik” feasting.</p>

<p>The traders say that recently a great desire has come upon the
natives to possess granite ware cooking utensils and drinking cups,
or those porcelain or silicon-plated iron vessels which we designate
by that name; they do not require washing, and can be easily wiped
out and never rust. Tin-ware is at a great discount among them—it
rusts. The odor of coal-oil will be noticed among many others
in the barraboras of the Aleutians and Kadiaks in these days, for
the general use of this fluid has been established. The glass lamps
and the smell suggestive of that illuminant can be plainly detected
by any stranger who goes into a village up there now, in spite of the
fishy and other indigenous strong aromas, which are in themselves
equally odious and penetrating. However, an old Aleutian fogy
will occasionally insist upon using a primitive stone lamp, with
a wicking of moss or strips of cotton cloth.</p>

<p>A marked fondness for pictures, old engravings, chromos, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
fact anything that goes in the line of caricature or illustration, is
manifested by the Aleutes. They paste all sorts of scraps from
newspapers, magazines, and theatrical posters, which the traders
give them, upon the walls of the barrabora. The Russians early
took notice of this trait, and the priests of the Greek Church made
good use of it by distributing richly-colored and gilded portraits
of holy men and women, the Imperial family, and mythological
church groups.</p>

<p>As the Aleut, his wife and children, and a relative or two, perhaps,
are living in the barrabora, he enjoys a warm and comfortable
shelter as long as he keeps it in good repair. He does not place
what he has of surplus supply in a cellar—such fish, fowl, or meat
as he may have in excess of immediate consumption is hung up outside
of his door on a wooden frame, or “laabaas.” Here it is beyond
the reach of dogs, and is quite secure, inasmuch as he lives in
no danger or dread of theft from the hands of his neighbors.</p>

<p>He is a fish-eater, like a vast majority of the rest of native Alaskans.
He has cod, halibut, salmon, trout, and herrings in overflowing
abundance, and all swim close to his door. He hooks and
nets his piscine food-supply all the year round as it rotates with
the seasons. He varies this steady diet with all the tea, sugar, and
hard bread, or flour, that he can purchase from the trader’s store;
some other little articles in the grocery line, such as canned California
fruits, are especially agreeable to his palate. These natives
call on the trader for biscuits, or sea-crackers, not because they
like this hard bread best, but on account of the scarcity of fuel
wherewith to properly bake up flour.</p>

<p>While fish is the staff of Aleutian daily life, yet nature has
vouchsafed many simple luxuries to those people: these are sea-urchins,
or echinoderms, and the eggs and flesh of the several species
of water-fowl peculiar to and abundant in such latitudes.
Then, in August and September, the valleys, hillsides, and margins
of the sea are resorted to by the natives for the huckleberries, the
“moroshkies,” the crowberries, and giant umbelliferous stalks of
the <em>Archangelica</em>, found ripe and ripening there. The Aleutian
huckleberries are much better than those of the Sitkan district, and
are really the only good indigenous fruit, according to the evidence
of our palates.</p>

</figure>

<p>Another peculiarity of an Aleutian village, which strikes a
stranger’s eye, is the irregular but frequent coming and going of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>a number of old women, and younger ones, to and from the mountains;
they always return with a burden of what appears to be
coarse grass upon their backs, in such huge bundles that the bearers
are quite hidden from view. These females, while not literally
hewers of wood, are really working as hard. They are gathering
the only natural resource which is afforded them for fuel. When
long and tedious journeys along the coast fail to reward a search
for drift-logs, which are found here and there in scant number at
the best, then the women repair to those spots on the mountain
sides where the slender strawberry-like runners of the crowberry<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
have grown and intergrown into thick masses. These they pull
from the earth, as we would gather dried grasses. A large bundle
is made for each woman in the party, and then, assisting each other
to load up, they stagger down the hillside trails, under these heavy
burdens, back to their respective barraboras. This “sheeksa” is
then air-dried, or weathered several weeks, so as to get it
ready and fit for use in those odd Russian ovens or “peechka”
stoves. It is twisted into short wisps, two or three of which at one
time are ignited, and thrust as they blaze, into the oven; then the
door of the peechka is closed tightly and promptly. This makes a
hot fire for a few moments; every particle of the heat is absorbed
by the thick, brick walls of the oven, so that, as it radiates slowly,
the small apartment within the earthen walls of the barrabora is
kept at a tropical temperature, for several hours at a time, without
a renewal of this fire. To-day, however, at Oonalashka, and at three
or four other central sea-otter villages, the natives are buying cord-wood
and coal from the traders. The wood is brought from
Kadiak, while the coal comes up as ballast from San Francisco in
the traders’ vessels.</p>

<p>Housed and fed in this manner, the entire Aleutian population
have been, and are living; as their children grow up and inherit
the parental homes, or branch out, after marrying, to erect barraboras
of their own, they repeat the same methods of their ancestry.
In a normal condition the Aleut is a quiet, peaceful parent, affectionate
but yet not demonstrative; he is kind to his wife and
imposes no real burden upon her which he does not fully share<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
himself. The children grow up without harsh discipline; still they
are not the recipients of marked attention. The family life, when
the head or the hunter is at home, is one of very simple routine;
he is in bed most of the time, striving to balance that account of
the very many sleepless nights he has passed in his bidarka scouring
sea-otter reefs during his recent three months’ trip, to Saanak or
the Chernaboors. The others rise at broad daylight, light their
blubber-fire in the outside kitchen, and prepare a slight breakfast
of crackers, tea, and boiled fresh fish. This meal is carried into the
living-room, where the “peechka” has been started up, so as to
thoroughly warm that apartment. If this native is the possessor of
a little iron stove, of our own make, then all heating and cooking
is done on the one fire made in it and the smoke of that burning fat
and oil with which so much of their fuel of drift-wood and sheeksa
is mixed, goes up the pipe and leaves no annoying trace behind.
Between the members of the household there is never much conversation—the
topics are few, indeed, beyond the ordinary routine of
irregular meals, and the desultory rising and retiring of a family.
This monotony of their lives is very much enlivened by exercises
of the church, to which they are constantly going and coming from.
But when they meet in a neighboring barrabkie, or receive friends
in their own, then tongues are loosened, and conversation flows
freely, especially over cups of tea between the old men and women;
the latter are incessant talkers under such genial encouragement.</p>

<p>Although the Aleut does not give you, at first, the least idea
that he has ever had any severe training of a heroic order, yet it is
a fact that most of the young men, ere they become recognized
hunters, had to “win their spurs,” as it were. The old men always
impress upon the native youth that great importance of strictly observing
the customs of their forefathers in conducting the chase, and
that neglect in this respect will surely bring upon them disaster
and punishment; therefore the young men are encouraged to go to
sea in gales of wind, and make difficult landings with their bidarkas
at surf-washed places. Before the advent of Russian priests,
every village had one or two old men at least, who considered it
their especial business to educate the children; thereupon, in the
morning or the evening when all were at home, these aged teachers
would seat themselves in the centre of one of the largest village
yourts or “oolagamuh:” the young folks surrounded them, and
listened attentively to what they said—sometimes failing memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
would cause the old preceptors to repeat over and over again the
same advice or legend in the course of a lecture. The respect of
the children, however, never allowed or occasioned an interruption
of such a senile oration.</p>

<p>But to-day their education, in so far as the strict sense of the
term goes, is received from the priests and deacons of the Greek
Church. They seem to have abandoned all the shamanism, the
mummery and savagery of their primitive lives eagerly and willingly
for those practices and precepts of the Christian faith; in this
strange accord the Kadiakers also joined. No recourse to violent
measures was ever resorted to by the Russian missionaries, who
were always met more than half-way by these singular heathen.
An Aleut is the better Christian when fairly compared with the
Kaniag—the latter is not half as sincere or faithful.</p>

<p>Stepan Glottov, in 1759, wintered, first of all white men, at
Oomnak Island, and he lived there then in perfect peace and quiet
with the natives; so amicable were his relations with these people,
that he persuaded their chief to be baptized, and to allow a little
son to go with Glottov to Kamchatka, where the youth lived
several years, then returned, well versed in the Russian language,
and assumed the title of supreme chief of the Aleutians; this is the
earliest record made of the conversion of these people. In 1796 the
first priest or missionary came among them; and never, from that
time to the present moment, has a representative of that church
ever been treated otherwise than well by these islanders.</p>

<p>The Aleutian brain has streaks of genuine philosophy and a
keen sense of humor. A priest once reproached an aged sire for
allowing a worthless son to worry and vex the household. “Why,
Ivan,” said he, “do you, who are so good, and Natalie, your wife,
also most excellent, permit this rude child to so deport himself?”
“Ah, father,” replied the old man with great emotion, “not out of
every sweet root grows a sweet plant!”</p>

<p>This inherent religious disposition of the Aleut is the reason
why we find a Greek church or a chapel in every little hamlet
where his people live. The exclusion of all other sects, however,
is natural, since the character of the ornate service and frequent
“prazniks,” or festivals of that chosen denomination, suits him best.
The Greek Catholic Bishop of the Alaskan diocese now resides in
Oonalashka. He used to make Sitka his headquarters, but the depopulation
of the whites there after the transfer of the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
made that spot too lonely for him, and he soon removed to San
Francisco. A few years ago a final transfer was made to Illoolook.
As far as possible the natives support their own respective
chapels, erect the church structures, keep them in repair, and make
an annual contribution sufficient to support a reader, or “deacon,”
so that the order of daily services shall be constantly in operation.
When a community is too poor, however, to do this, then the
bishop has money supplied to him by the Russian Home Church
Fund, which he uses to maintain the proper conduct of those chapels
situated at impecunious settlements. Of course these outlying
and far-distant hamlets of the Aleutian archipelago are unable to
secure and pay, each one, for the services of a regularly ordained
resident priest. Therefore a parish priest, either from Oonalashka,
Belcovsky, Sitka, or even San Francisco, is in the habit of making
a tour of the entire Alaskan circuit once in every year or two, so
as to administer the higher offices of the church, such as baptism,
marriage, etc.</p>

<p>Most amusing is that intense outward piety of these grimy people—they
greet you with a blessing and a prayer for your good
health in the same breath, and they part from you murmuring a
benediction. They never sit down to their rude meals without
asking the blessing of God; never enter a neighbor’s house without
crossing themselves at the threshold; and in most of the barraboras
a little image-picture of a patron saint will be found in one
corner, high up on a shelf, to which the face of every member of
the family is always turned when they rise and retire—the head
bowed and the cross sign made before this “eikon,” in humility
and silence. These people also carry the precepts and phraseology
of the church upon their lips, constantly repeating them during
holy weeks and pious festivals.</p>

<p>The fact that among all the savage races found on the northwest
coast by Christian pioneers and teachers, the Aleutians are the only
practical converts to Christianity, goes far, in my opinion, to set
them apart as very differently constituted in mind and disposition
from our Indians and our Eskimo of Alaska. To the latter, however,
they seem to be intimately allied, though they do not mingle
in the slightest degree. They adopted the Christian faith with
very little opposition, readily exchanging their barbarous customs
and wild superstitions for the rites of the Greek Catholic Church
and its more refined myths and legends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>At the time of their first discovery, they were living as savages
in every sense of the word, bold and hardy, throughout the Aleutian
chain, but now they respond, on these islands, to all outward
signs of Christianity, as sincerely as our own church-going people.
The question as to the derivation of those natives is still a mooted
one among ethnologists, for in all points of personal bearing, intelligence,
character, as well as physical structure, they seem to form
a perfect link of gradation between the Japanese and Eskimo, notwithstanding
their traditions and their language are entirely distinct
and peculiar to themselves; not one word or numeral of their
nomenclature resembles the dialect of either. They claim, however,
to have come first to the Aleutian Islands from a “big land
in the westward,” and that when they came there first they found
the land uninhabited, and that they did not meet with any people,
until their ancestors had pushed on to the eastward as far as the
peninsula and Kadiak. Confirmatory of this legend, or rather
highly suggestive of it, is the fact that repeated instances have
occurred within our day where Japanese junks have been, in the
stress of hurricanes and typhoons, dismantled, and have drifted
clear over and on to the reefs and coasts of the Aleutian Islands.
Only a short time ago, in the summer of 1871, such a craft was so
stranded, helpless and at the mercy of the sea, upon the rocky
coast of Adak Island, in this chain; the few surviving sailors,
Japanese, five in number, were rescued by a party of Aleutian sea-otter
hunters, who took care of them until the vessel of a trader
carried them back, by way of Oonalashka, to San Francisco, and
thence they returned to their native land.</p>

<p>A number of the males in every Aleutian village will be found
who can read and write with the Russian alphabet. This education
they get in the line of church exercises, inasmuch as they are all
conducted in the Russian language, though the responses for the
congregation usually are made by Aleutian accents. An Aleut
grammar and phonetic alphabet, adapted to the expression of the
Russian language, is used in all of these hamlets. It was prepared
by that remarkable man, Veniaminov, in 1831: a large number of
the books were printed, and they have been in use ever since. The
young men and boys are taught as they grow up, by the church
deacon usually, to read, first in the Aleut dialect, then in the Russian.
The traders take advantage of this understanding among
these people, and facilitate their bartering very materially. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
give every hunter a pass, or grocer’s book, in which he keeps a regular
account, charging what he may need, in advance of payment,
so enabling his family to get what it requires during his long absence
on the hunting-grounds. In short, that book is a regular
letter of credit at the store, and the traders have found it the best
way of influencing the natives in their favor, and also of aiding the
superior hunters.</p>

<p>This method of credit has developed, and made manifest the
truth of a strong statement in which Veniaminov declared his
belief that these people were really honest at heart, totally unlike
all other savages in Alaska, or elsewhere on the American continent,
for that matter. Many of the hunters, when they are about to depart
for a long four or five months’ sea-otter chase, and consequent
absence for such length of time from home, go to the trader and
tell him to restrict their wives from overdrawing a certain pecuniary
limit, which they fix of their own idea as to what they can afford.
This action, however, is the purpose of true honesty only, for those
same hunters, when they get back, after first religiously settling
every indebtedness in full, make at once a heavy draft upon any
surplus that they may have, going so far in the line of extravagance
and singular improvidence, in some instances, as to purchase, on
the spur of the moment, music-boxes worth two hundred dollars
each, or whole bolts of silk and costly packages of handkerchiefs,
neckties, and white linen, and many other things of a like nature,
wholly unwarranted by the means of the hunter, or of any real
service to him or his family.</p>

<p>The church “prazniks,” or festivals, are very quiet affairs, but
when the Aleut determines to celebrate his birthday or “eman
nimik,” he goes about it in full resolution to have a stirring and
vociferous time. Therefore he brews a potential beer by putting a
quantity of sugar, flour, rice, and dried apples (if he can get the
latter) into a ten or twenty-gallon barrel, which is filled with water.
He sends invitations out to his friends so dated as to bring them to
the barrabkie when a right degree of fermentation in the kvass-barrel
shall have arrived; sometimes the odor of that barrel itself is
sufficient to gather them in all on time. Some one of the natives
who is famous for natural and cultivated skill in playing the accordion
or concertina, is given the post of honor and the best of the
beer; he or she, as the case may be, soon starts the most hilarious
dancing, because Aleutes are exceedingly fond of this amusement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
especially so when stimulated by beer. If the apartment is
large enough, the figures of an old Russian quadrille are gone
through with, accompanied by indescribable grimaces and grotesque
side-shuffles of the dancers, the old women and young
men being the most demonstrative. Usually, however, a single
waltzing couple has the floor at one time, whirling around with the
liveliest hop-waltz steps, and as it settles down out of breath, a
fresh pair springs up from the waiting and watching circle. The
guests rapidly pass from their normal sedateness into the varying
stages that rotate between slight and intense drunkenness.</p>

<p>These kvass orgies, on such occasions, are the only exhibitions
of disorder that the people of the Aleutian Islands and Kadiak ever
afford. At Belcovsky, and at every point where the sea-otter industry
is most remunerative to the native hunter, there you will
find the greatest misery, due wholly to those beery birthday celebrations
as sketched above.</p>

<p>Some traders often give entertainments to the natives, in which
they wisely offer plenty of strong tea, with white sugar-lumps, and
nothing else; these parties are quite reputable and highly enjoyed
by all concerned. The floor of the warehouse, or the living-rooms
of the trader himself, are cleared, and this allows ample
space for a full-figured cotillon or quadrille, or a dozen or two of
dancing couples. The ball-room of the chief trading-firm at
Oonalashka is a very animated and extensive prospect when an
evening-party of this sort is in fine motion. The familiar strains of
“Pinafore,” the “Lancers,” “John Brown,” and “Marching through
Georgia,” rise in piercing strength from the vigorous men and
women who are squeezing the accordions, and every now and then
a few of the young Aleutes break out into a short singing refrain,
using English words to suit the music, as they caper in the
high-tide of this festivity. It is the young men, however, only,
who thus vocalize; the women, when sober, old and young,
are always silent, with downcast eyes, and are very abject in demeanor.</p>

<p>The great feminine solace in a well-to-do native hut is recourse
to a concertina or accordion, as the case may be. These instruments
are especially adapted to the people. Their plaintive, slow
measure, when fingered in response to native tunes and old
Slavonian ballads, always rise upon the air in every Aleutian
hamlet, from early morning until far into night. An appreciation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
of good music is keen: many of the women can easily pick up
strains from our own operas, and repeat them correctly after listening
a short while to the trader or his wife play and sing. They
are most pleased with sad, wailing tunes, such as “Lorena,” the
“Old Cabin Home,” and the like.</p>

<p>Thus we note those salient characteristics of Aleutians, who
are the most interesting and praiseworthy inhabitants of Alaska.
There are not a great many of them, however, when contrasted
numerically with the Indians and the Eskimo of this region; but
they come closer, far nearer to us in good fellowship and human
sympathy. We turn, therefore, from them again to resume our
contemplation of the country in which they live. The sun is burning
through a gray-blue bank of sea-swept fog, ever and anon
shining down brilliantly upon the beautiful, vividly green mountains,
and glancing from the clear waters of Oonalashka’s harbor.
It tempts us to walk, to stroll, when the trader tells us that we can
easily cross over to Beaver Bay, where Captain Cook anchored and
refitted in 1778. So we go, and a patient, good-humored native
trots ahead to keep us on the road and bring us back safely, lest
the fog descend and shut all in darkness which is now so light and
bright. A narrow foot-trail that is deeply worn by the pigeon-toed
Aleutes into moss and sphagnum, or fairly choked by rank-growing
grasses and annuals in low warm spots, winds around and
over the divide between Oonalashka village and Borka. As we reach
the rippling, rocky strand of Beaver Bay, a cascade arrests our attention
on account of its exceeding beauty. Tumbling down from
the brow of a lofty bluff of brown and reddish rocks, a rivulet falls
in a line of snowy spray, which reflects prismatic colors from the
rocks and sunlight as it drops into the cold embrace of the sea.
While we, resting on the grassy margin of the beach, enjoy this
charming picture, our native turns his face to the bay, and he
points out to us the pebbly shore where Captain Cook “hove
down” his vessel, more than a century ago, and then scraped those
barnacles and sea-weed growths from that ship’s bottom. Here the
English discoverer first came in contact with the natives of Oonalashka,
and there are people over on Spirkin or “Borka” Island,
just across the bay from us, who will recite the legend of this early
visit of that Englishman with great earnestness, circumspection,
and detail, so faithfully has the story been transmitted from
father to son. Their own name of Samahgaanooda was changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
voluntarily to English Bay, or “Anglieeski Bookhta,” by which
designation they themselves call the harbor to-day.</p>

<p>A broad expanse of this bay lies directly between us on the
north side and the village of Borka, which is perched on a narrow
beach-level shelf of an island that rises bold and abruptly, high
from the sea. This hamlet is the most remarkable native settlement
in all Alaska with respect to a strange and unwonted cleanliness
which is exhibited in this community of one hundred and forty
Aleutes, who are living here to-day in twenty-eight frame houses, barraboras,
and a chapel. What makes it still more remarkable is the
fact that these people are in close communication with their kindred
of Oonalashka, who are distant only a few hours’ journey by canoe
and portage, and who are not especially cleanly to the slightest noteworthy
degree. Those people of Borka are living in the cleanest
and neatest of domiciles. They are living so without an exceptional
instance, every hut being as tidy and as orderly as its neighbor.
They have large windows in the small frame houses and barraboras,
scrub and sand the floors, and keep their simple furniture, their beds,
and window-panes polished and bright. Glass tumblers, earthen
pots, and wooden firkins filled with transplanted wild-flowers
stand on the tables and deep window-sills to bloom fresh and sweet
all the year round. A modest, unassuming old Russian Creole
trader, who has lived there all his life, and who was living recently,
is credited with this influence for the better with the natives. Certainly
he is the only one who has ever succeeded in working such a
revolution in the slovenly, untidy household habits of these amiable
but shiftless people.</p>

<p>As we retrace our steps to Oonalashka village we become fully impressed
with the size of this island. It bears so many mountain spurs,
with a singularly rugged, cut-up coast, in which the deep indentations
or gulf-fiörds nearly sever the island in twain as they run in to almost
meet from the north and south sides. Beautiful mats of wild
poppies are nodding their yellow heads as the gusts sweep over them
on the hillsides, and a rank, rich growth of tall grasses by the creek-margins
and the sea-shore in sheltered places shimmers and sways
like so many fields of uncut green grain do at home. Vegetation
everywhere, except on the summits of the highest peaks and ridges
and the mural faces of the bluffs! Even there some tiny lichens
grow, however, and give rich tones of golden ochre and purplish-bronzed
reflections from the cold, moist rocks, whereto they cling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>We pause in that little cemetery, just outside of the village of
Illoolook. It is on a small knoll, under higher hills that rear
themselves over it. Its disorder and neglect is a fair reminder of
what we see in most of our own rural graveyards. The practice of
all these natives is to inter by digging a shallow grave. The body
is prepared in its best clothes, and coffined in a plain wooden box.
A small mound and a larger or smaller wooden Greek cross is the
only monument. Tiny oil-portraits of their patron saints, painted
on tin or sheet-iron, especially made for these purposes, and furnished
by the Church, are tacked to the crosses, with now and then
a rude Russian inscription carved or painted thereon in addition.
During certain periods of the summer, when the weather is pleasant,
little squads of relatives will come out here from the village
and pass a whole day in tea-drinking and renovating the crosses,
sitting on the mounds as they chat, work, and boil their samovar.
The Illoolook church-bells ring—they arouse us to resume the walk
thus interrupted in this small city of Aleutian dead. As we enter
the town, we see the occupants of turfy barraboras and frame
cottages hastening from every quarter and trooping to the door
of a yellow-walled and red-roofed house of worship. Perched
on that three-barred cross which crowns the cupola of this chapel
are half a dozen big black ravens, all croaking most lugubriously,
as the clanging chimes peal out below them. That is their favorite
roosting-place. The natives take no notice of those ill-omened birds,
which as feathered scavengers, hop around the barraboras in perfect
security, since no one ever disturbs them, unless it be some graceless
trader who is anxious to test the killing power of a new shotgun.
They breed in high chinks of the bluffs, and find abundant
food cast upon the beaches by the sea. A few domestic fowls, some
with broods of newly-hatched chicks, are running about or scratching
around the place. The priest’s shaggy little bull and cow
stand in front of a small stable or “scoatnik,” lazily chewing their
cud. There is no other live-stock in the hamlet, except a few dogs
and cats; not a great many of the latter, however.</p>

<p>West of this Island of Oonalashka is a narrow-lined stretch of
more than eight hundred miles of rapidly-succeeding islets and
islands, until the extreme limit of the Alaskan border is reached at
Attoo. In all this dreary wilderness of land and water only three
small human settlements are to be found to-day, with a population
of less than five hundred natives and six or seven white men.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>Attoo, Atkha, and Oomnak are the only villages, the last closely adjoins
Oonalashka, on a large island of the same name.</p>

</figure>

<p>Attoo is the extreme western town which is or can be located on
the North American continent. It is the first land made and discovered
by the Russians, as they became acquainted with the Aleutian
chain. Michael Novodiskov, a sailor who had survived Bering
and the wreck of the <em>St. Peter</em> in 1741, took command of a small
shallop in 1745, and sailed from Lower Kamchatka. He reached
Attoo, and also landed on its sister island of Aggatoo, in the same
season. The Aleutes were then numerous, bold, and richly supplied
with sea-otter skins. Now, nothing but the ruined sites of
once populous villages remain behind to attest the truth of that
early Russian narrative; and the descendants, who number but a
little more than one hundred souls, are living in a small hamlet
that nestles in the shelter of that beautiful harbor on the north side
of Attoo Island, at the rear of which abrupt hills and high mountains
suddenly rise. A sand-beach before the village is fringed
by a most luxurious growth of rank grass, that wild wheat of the
north, the tasselled seed-plumes of which are waving as high as
the waists, and even the heads of the natives themselves.</p>

<p>Sea-otters have been virtually exterminated or driven from
the coast here, so that the residents of Attoo are, in worldly goods,
poor indeed; and a small trader’s store is stationed here, more for
the sake of charity than of commercial gain. But they have an
abundance of sea-lion meat, of eggs and water-fowl; a profusion of
fish—cod, halibut, algæ mackerel, and a few salmon. They have a
liberal supply of drift-wood landed by currents upon the shores of
this and the contiguous rugged islets. Several times during the
last ten years have traders endeavored to coax these inhabitants
to abandon Attoo and go with them to better situations for sea-otter
hunting. But, although pinched by poverty, yet so strongly
attached are they to this lonely island of their birth, that they have
obstinately declined. Though they are poor, yet the contrast between
their cheerful, healthy faces and those debauched countenances
which we observed at the wealthy villages of Protassov
and Belcovsky is a delightful one, and preaches an eloquent sermon
in its own reflection. Naturally the people of Attoo do not
enjoy much sugar, tea, cloth, and other little articles which they
have learned to covet from the trader’s store; so we find them living
nearer the primitive style of Aleutian ancestry than elsewhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
in the archipelago, being dressed largely in tanned seal and bird-skins,
of the fashion made and worn by their forefathers who welcomed
Novodiskov long, long ago.</p>

<p>The necessity of doing something in order to gain from the
trader a few of the simplest articles, such as the natural resources
of Attoo utterly failed to supply, has driven the natives to the care
and conservation of blue foxes, which they introduced here many
years past, and of which they secure, in traps, two or three hundred
every season. The common red fox<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> of the whole Aleutian
chain became extinct here in prior time; so, taking advantage of
this fact, those blue foxes, so abundant and so valuable on the Seal
Islands, were imported, and have ranged without deterioration,
since ice-floes never bridge the straits that isolate this island from
the nearest adjacent land, and upon which the common breed might
cross over to ruin the quality of the fur of that transported <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vulpes
lagopus</i>. They have also domesticated the wild goose, and rear flocks
of them around their barraboras, being the only people in Alaska
who have ever done so.</p>

<p>It hardly seems credible, at first thought, but the village of
Attoo makes San Francisco practically the half-way town as we go
from Calais, Me., to it, our westernmost settlement! It is really
but slightly short of being just midway, since Attoo stands almost
three thousand miles west of the Golden Gate.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> A strict geographical
centre of the American Union is that point at sea forty
miles off the Columbia River mouth, on the coast of Oregon.</p>

<p>The nearest neighbors of the Attoo villagers are not of their
own kith and kin—they are the Atkhan and Kamchadale Creoles
and natives of the Russian Seal Islands, some two hundred miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
west; but on our side they are separated by more than four hundred
and thirty miles of stormy water from the first inhabited
island, which is Atkha, where a much larger and a much more fortunately
situated settlement exists on its east coast, at Nazan Bay.
Here is a community of over two hundred and thirty souls, being
all the people gathered together who previously lived in small scattered
hamlets on the many large and small islands between Atkha
and Attoo. They secure a comparatively good number of sea-otters,
and are relatively well-to-do, being able to excite and sustain
much activity in the trader’s store.</p>

<p>General agreement among those who have visited the Atkhans,
as traders and agents of the Government, is that these natives are
the finest body of sea-otter hunters in all respects known to the
business. They make long journeys from their homes, carried to
the outlying islands of Semeisopochnoi, Amchitka, Tanaga, Kanaga,
Adahk and Nitalikh, Siguam and Amookhta, some of them far distant,
on which they establish camps and search the reefs and rocks
awash, as they learn by experience where the chosen haunts of the
shy sea-otter are. Here they remain engaged in the chase over
extended periods of months at a time, when, in accord with a preconcerted
date arranged with the traders, those schooners which
carried them out from Atkha, return, pick them up, and take them
back. Then the trader’s store is made a grand rendezvous for the
village; the hunters tally their skins, settle their debts, make their
donations to the church, and then promptly invest their surplus in
every imaginable purchase which the goods displayed will warrant.</p>

<p>The women of Atkha employ long intervals, in which their
husbands and sons are absent, by making the most beautifully
woven grass baskets and mats. The finest samples of this weaving
ever produced by a savage or semi-civilized people are those which
come from Atkha. The girls and women gather grasses at the
proper season, and prepare them with exceeding care for their
primitive methods of weaving; and they spare no amount of labor
and pains in the execution of their designs, which are now almost
entirely those suggested by the traders, such as fancy sewing-baskets,
cigar-holders, table-mats, and special forms that are eagerly
accepted in trade, for they find a ready sale in San Francisco.</p>

<p>A peculiar and valuable food-fish is found in the Atkhan waters
which has been attracting a great deal of attention as a substitute
for the mackerel of our east coast, inasmuch as there is no such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
fish found oil the Alaskan coasts. Among the sea-weed that floats
in immense rafts everywhere throughout the Aleutian passes, the
“yellow-fish,” or “Atkha mackerel,”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> is very abundant; it is also
plentiful off the Shoomagin Islands. It is a good substitute for
the real mackerel,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> resembling it in taste after salting, as well as in
size and movements.</p>

<p>During early days of Russian order and control, the people of
Atkha lived altogether on the north side of the island, and it was
then the grand central depot of the old Russian American Company.
A chief factor was in charge, who had exclusive jurisdiction
over all that country embraced in the Kurile archipelago, and the
Commander group of Kamchatka, and the Aleutian chain as far
east as Oomnak. It was a very important place then, and this territory
of its jurisdiction was styled the “Atkhan Division.” But
within the last ten or twelve years, fish and drift-wood became very
scarce on the Bering Sea coast, so the inhabitants made a sweeping
removal of everything from the ancient site on Korovinsky Bay to
that of Nazan, where the little hamlet now stands, overtopped by
lofty peaks and hills on every side, except where it looks out over
the straits to the bold headlands of Seguam. So thorough were
they in this “nova-sailnah,” that they even disinterred the remains
of their first priest and re-buried them in front of their new chapel—a
delightful exhibition of fond memory and respect where we
might, perhaps, have least thought to have found them manifested.</p>

<p>The curious Island of Amlia shuts out the heavy swell of the
Pacific Ocean from Nazan Harbor, and gives that little bay great
peace and protection. This island is thirty miles in length, and
nowhere has it a breadth of over four miles; most of its entire
extent is only some two miles from ocean to ocean. It consists of
a string of sharp, conical peaks, which once were active volcanoes,
but now cold and silent as the tomb. So abruptly do they rise
from the oceans which they divide, that there is but one small spot
on the south side where a vessel can lie at anchor and effect a
landing.</p>

<p>Atkha is a large island, and it has very slight resemblance to
that of Oonalashka in shape; its indented fiörds are, however, less
deep and not near so commodious and accessible. The snowy,
smoking crater of Korovinsky Sopka stands like a grim sentinel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
overlooking the north end of the island, a sheer five thousand feet
above the sea-beach at its feet. A few miles to the south another
rises to almost as great an elevation, from the flanks of which
a number of hot springs pour out a steady boiling flood; then,
at the northeast extremity, and handsomely visible from the village,
is a silent, snowy crater which they call Sarichev. Korovinsky is
the only disturber of the peace that rightfully belongs to Atkha. It
is constantly emitting smoke and ashes, while earthquakes and
subterranean noises are felt and heard all over the island at frequent
though irregular periods during the entire year. In the ravines
and cañons of this volcano and its satellites are the only glaciers
which the geologist has ever been able to find on any of these
peaked, lofty islands west of Oonalashka, though a hundred eternal
snow-clad summits and a thousand snow-filled gorges are easily
discerned. The natives here also describe a series of mud-volcanoes,
or “mud-pots,” that exist on the island, in which this stuff is constantly
boiling up with all the colors of the rainbow, about as they
seethe and puff in the Geyser Basin of the Yellowstone Park.</p>

<p>There are a dozen or so small, mountainous, uninhabited islands
between Atkha and the larger island of Adakh in the west. Very
little is known of them, since they endanger life if a landing is
made. The most imposing one is Sitkhin, a round, mountainous,
lofty mass which culminates in a snow-covered peak over five thousand
feet in height. The crater is dead, however, and no sign of
ancient volcanic energy is now displayed, beyond the emission of
hot springs from fissures in its rocky flanks. Adakh itself is quite a
large island, rough and hilly to an excessive degree. A grand cone,
which rises up directly in the centre high above all the rest, is called
the “white crater.” It is also a dead volcano like Sitkhin; but
steamy vapors from outpouring hot waters rise in many valleys
and from the uplands. A succession of volcanic peaks reared from
the sea, a few of them still smoking and muttering, constitute the
islands of Tanaga and Kanaga in the vicinity of Adakh. No place
is feasible for a boat to land on either of these wild islets, except on
the west shore of Tanaga in Slava Rossia Bay.</p>

<p>A single immense peak, rising all by itself, solitary and alone,
from the girdle of surf that encircles it—a band of foaming breakers
eighteen miles in circumference, is the islet of Goreloi. It is a
formidable rival of the majestic volcano of Shishaldin, on Oonimak.
Though nearly as high, yet it is not so symmetrical a cone. Wreaths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
and solid banks of fog are pressed against its volcanic sides, and
hang around its glittering white head, so that the full impression
of its grandeur cannot strike us as we gaze at its defiant presence,
where, unsupported, it alone beats back the swell of a vast ocean.</p>

<p>That cluster of islands which stand between Goreloi and Attoo
is an aggregate of cold volcanic peaks—Amchitka and Kyska being
the largest—the Seven Peaks, or Semiseisopochnoi, smoking a
little, all the rest entirely quiet. They offer no hospitality to a
traveller, and the natives have done wisely in abandoning these savage
island-solitudes to reside at Nazan Bay, where the country has
a most genial aspect, and many stretches of warm sand-dune tracts
are found, upon which vegetation springs into luxuriant life. Here,
also, quite a herd of Kamchatkan cattle were cared for when the
Russian régime was in vogue. This stock-raising effort was not a
practical success, however, and the last of the bovine race disappeared
very shortly after the country changed ownership. Goats
were also introduced here, as well as elsewhere throughout the fur-trading
posts of the old company in Alaska; but the morbid propensity
of those pugnacious little animals to feed upon the grasses
which grow over roofs of the barraboras, and thus break in and
otherwise damage such earthen tenements, made them so unpopular
that their propagation was energetically and successfully discouraged
by the suffering Aleutes.</p>

<p>Two hundred miles of uninhabited waste extends between the
natives of Atkha and their nearest neighbors, the villagers of Nikolsky,
who live in a small, sheltered bight of the southwest shore of
Oomnak. This is one of the largest islands of the whole Aleutian
group, very mountainous, with three commanding, overlooking
peaks that are most imposing in their rugged elevation. Several
large lakes nestle in their hilly arms, and feed salmon rivulets that
rush in giddy rapids and cascades down to the ocean. Everything
grows at Oomnak which we have noticed on its sister island of
Oonalashka, except the willow; while cross and red foxes are much
more abundant here than at any other place in the whole archipelago.
A great many hot springs boil up on the north side, and only
as recently as 1878 a decided volcanic shock was experienced, which
resulted in the upheaval of a small mud-crater between the village
and Toolieskoi Sopka, a huge fire-mountain of the middle
interior. Subterranean noises and tremors of the earth are chronic
phenomena here, but the natives pay no attention to them. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
complain, however, of inability to find fish where they usually found
them in abundance prior to these earthquakes. Redoubled attention,
however, is paid to the salmon when they run, and thus the
deficiency is made up.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">[<em>Unrolled from its cerements.</em>]</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Before the coming of the Russians, Oomnak was one of the
most populous islands; then there were over twenty villages, some
of them quite large. One was so big that “the inhabitants of it
were able to eat the carcass of an enormous whale in a single day!”
The most stubborn and independent spirit displayed by the Aleutes
prior to their subjugation was exhibited by the inhabitants of this
island. The four or five thousand hardy savages which the promishlyniks
met here in 1757-59 have dwindled to a microscopic
number of less than one hundred and thirty souls, who reside at
Nikolsky to-day. They enjoy a somewhat better climate, for a good
deal less snow falls here than at Oonalashka, and the small vegetable-garden
does much better than elsewhere, except at Attoo.
They raise domestic fowls, and have a very fair sea-otter catch
every winter, when they scour the south coast, and reside for months
at Samalga, hunting that animal. Furious gales which prevail
during certain seasons drive kahlans out upon the south beach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
there to rest from the pelting of storms: then they are speedily
apprehended and clubbed by the watchful Oomnak hunter.</p>

<p>That curious group, the “Cheetiery Sopochnie,” or Islands of the
Four Mountains, stands right across the straits, opposite Oomnak.
From Kaygamilak, which lies nearest, eleven mummies were taken as
they were found in a warm cave on the northeast side of this island.
These bodies were placed there in 1724, or some twenty-five or
thirty years before the Russians first appeared. The mummies<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
were in fine preservation, and were the remains of a noted chief
and his family, who in that time ruled with an iron hand over a
large number of his people. The Island of Kayamil is a mere volcanic
series of fire-chimneys, the walls of which are not yet cool.
The southeast shore in olden times was the site of several large
settlements, where the people lived well upon an abundance of
sea-lions, hair-seals, and water-fowl, which still repair to its borders.
Now that it is desolate and uninhabitable, large flocks of
tundra geese spend the summers here, as they shed their feathers
and rear their young, not a fox to vex or destroy them having
been left by those prehistoric Aleutian hunters.</p>

<p>But on Tahnak, which is the largest of the group, plenty of red
foxes are reported. The loftiest summits are also on this one of
the four islets, and on the south side once lived a race of the most
warlike and ferocious of all Aleutes. They were destroyed to a man
by Glottov, and their few descendants have long since been merged
with those of Oomnak, where they now live. Several small, high,
bluffy islands stand around Tahnak, and between it and its sister,
Oonaska, which is nearly as large, equally rugged and precipitous.
Amootoyon is a quite small islet, and completes the quartet of
“Cheetiery Sopochnie.”</p>

<p>A most interesting volcanic phenomenon of recent record is
afforded by the study of that small Bogaslov islet which now stands
hot and smoking twenty miles north of Oomnak, and which, two
years ago, raised a great commotion by firing up anew. In the
autumn of 1796 the natives of Oomnak and Oonalashka were
startled by a series of loud reports like parks of artillery, followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
by tremblings of the earth upon which they stood. Then a dense
dark cloud, full of gas and ashes, came down upon them from
Bering Sea, swept by a northerly wind, and it hung over their
astonished heads for a week or ten days, accompanied by earthquakes
and subterranean thunder; then when an interval of clearing
occurred by a change of winds, they saw distinctly to the
northward a bright light burning over the sea. The boldest
launched their bidarkas, and, after a close inspection, saw that a
small island had been elevated about one hundred feet above the
level of the surrounding waters; that it had been forced up from
some fissure of the bottom to the sea, and was still rising, while
liquid streams of lava and scoriæ made it impossible for them to
land. This plutonic action did not cease here until 1825, when it
left above the green waters of Bering Sea an isolated oval peak with
a serrated crest, almost inaccessible, some two hundred and eighty
feet high, and two or three miles in circumference. The Russians
landed here then for the first time, and the rocks were so hot that
they passed but a few moments ashore. It has, however, cooled
off enough now to be occupied by large herds of sea-lions, and is resorted
to by flocks of sea-fowl. In this fashion of the making of
Bogaslov was our vast chain of the Aleutian archipelago cast up
from that line of least resistance in the earth’s crust which is now
marked by the position of these islands, as they alternately face the
billows of the immense wastes of the Pacific, and those storm-tossed
waves of the shoal sea of Bering.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_69" href="#FNanchor_69" class="label">[69]</a> Bishop Veniaminov, who witnessed one of these eruptions in 1825,
describes the occurrence: “On the 10th March, 1825, after a prolonged subterranean
noise resembling a heavy cannonade, that was plainly heard on the
islands of Oonalashka, Akoon, and the southern end of the Alaska Peninsula, a
low ridge at the northwestern end of Oonimak opened in five places with
violent emissions of flames and great masses of black ashes, covering the country
for miles around; the ice and snow on the mountain tops melted and
descended in a terrific torrent five to ten miles in width, on the eastern side
of the island. The Shishaldin crater, which up to that time had also emitted
flames, continued to smoke only.”</p>

spread, then a sprinkling of powdered sulphur was cast over the moss or
feathers, then a large quartzite stone was grasped in the native’s hand, who
struck it down with all his force upon this preparation. The concussion produced
fire, and, when feathers were used, a terrible smell.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="label">[71]</a> The range and diverse beauties of the numerous mosses and lichens on
these islands must serve as an agreeable and interesting study to anyone who
has the slightest love for nature. They undoubtedly formed the first covering
to the naked rocks, after these basaltic foundations had been reared upon and
above the bed of the sea—bare and naked cliffs and boulders, which with
calm intrepidity presented their callous fronts to the powerful chisels of the
Frost King. Rain, wind, and thawing moods destroyed their iron-bound
strongness; particles larger and finer, washed down and away, made a surface
of soil which slowly became more and more capable of sustaining vegetable
life. “In this virgin earth,” says an old author, “the wind brings a small
seed, which at first generates a diminutive moss, which, spreading by degrees,
with its tender and minute texture, resists, however, the most intense cold,
and extends over the whole a verdant velvet carpet. In fact, these mosses are
the medicines and the nurses of the other inhabitants of the vegetable kingdom
[in the North]. The bottom parts of the mosses, which perish and
moulder away yearly, mingling with the dissolved but as yet crude parts of
the earth, communicate to it organized particles, which contribute to the
growth and nourishment of other plants. They likewise yield salts and unguinous
phlogistic particles for the nourishment of future vegetable colonies,
the seeds of other plants, which the sea and winds, or else the birds in their
plumage, bring from distant shores and scatter among the mosses.” Then the
botanist needs no prompting when he observes the maternal care of these
mosses, which screen the tender new arrivals from the cold and imbue them
with the moisture which they have stored up, and “nourish them with their
own oily exhalations, so that they grow, increase, and at length bear seeds,
and afterward dying, add to the unguinous nutritive particles of the earth;
and at the same time diffuse over this new earth and mosses more seeds, the
earnest of a numerous posterity.”</p>

rub over their spear-heads, being carefully dried and preserved for that purpose.
Again, in ancient times, the pursuit of the whale was the prelude to

<p class="no-indent">The story of the gloomy grandeur of Alaskan scenery and the wild
existence of its inhabitants is not half told until that picture of
what we observe on the Pribylov Islands of Bering Sea is graphically
drawn. Here is annually presented one of the most marvellous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
exhibitions of massed animal-life that is known to man,
civilized or savage; here is exhibited the perfect working of an
anomalous industry, conducted without a parallel in the history of
human enterprise, and of immense pecuniary and biological value.</p>

<p>In treating this subject the writer has trusted to nothing save
what he himself has seen, for, until these life-studies were made by
him, no succinct and consecutive history of the lives and movements
of these animals had been published by any man. Fanciful
yarns, woven by the ingenuity of whaling captains, in which the
truth was easily blended with that which was not true, and short
paragraphs penned hastily by naturalists of more or less repute,
formed the knowledge that we had. Best of all was the old diary
of Steller, who, while suffering bodily tortures, the legacy of gangrene
and scurvy, when wrecked with Bering on the Commander
Islands, showed the nerve, the interest, and the energy of a true
naturalist. He daily crept, with aching bones and watery eyes,
over the boulders and mossy flats of Bering Island to catch glimpses
of those strange animals which abode there then as they abide to-day.
Considering the physical difficulties that environed Steller,
the notes made by him on the sea-bears of the North Pacific are
remarkably good; but, as I have said, they fall so far from giving
a fair and adequate idea of what these immense herds are and do
as to be absolutely valueless for the present hour. Shortly after
Steller’s time great activity sprang up in the South Atlantic and
Pacific over the capture and sale of fur-seal skins taken in those
localities It is extraordinary that, though whole fleets of American,
English, French, Dutch, and Portuguese vessels engaged during
a period of protracted enterprise of over eighty years in length
in the business of repairing to the numerous rookeries of the Antarctic,
returning annually laden with enormous cargoes of fur-seal
skins, yet, as above mentioned, hardly a definite line of record has
been made in regard to the whole transaction, involving, as it did,
so much labor and so much capital.</p>

<p>The fact is, that the acquisition of these pelagic peltries had engaged
thousands of men, and that millions of dollars had been employed
in capturing, dressing, and selling fur-seal skins during the
hundred years just passed by; nevertheless, from the time of Steller,
away back as far as 1751, up to the beginning of the last decade,
the scientific world actually knew nothing definite in regard
to the life history of this valuable animal. The truth connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
with the life of the fur-seal, as it herds in countless myriads on the
Pribylov Islands of Alaska, is far stranger than fiction. Perhaps
the existing ignorance has been caused by confounding the hair-seal,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phoca vitulina</i>, and its kind, with the creature now under discussion.
Two animals, more dissimilar in their individuality and
method of living, can, however, hardly be imagined, although
they belong to the same group, and live apparently upon the same
food.</p>

<p>The following notes, surveys, and hypotheses herewith presented
are founded upon the writer’s personal observations in the seal-rookeries
of St. Paul and St. George, during the seasons of 1872 to
1874 inclusive, supplemented by his confirmatory inspection made
in 1876. They were obtained during long days and nights of consecutive
observation, from the beginning to the close of each seal-season,
and cover, by actual surveys, the entire ground occupied by
these animals.</p>

<p>During the progress of heated controversies that took place
pending the negotiation which ended in the acquisition of Alaska
by our Government, frequent references were made to the fur-seal.
Strange to say, this animal was so vaguely known at that time, even
to scientific men, that it was almost without representation in any
of the best zoölogical collections of the world; even the Smithsonian
Institution did not possess a perfect skin and skeleton. The
writer, then as now, an associate and collaborator of that establishment,
had his curiosity very much excited by these stories; and in
March, 1872, he was, by the joint action of Professor Baird and the
Secretary of the Treasury, enabled to visit the Pribylov Islands for
the purpose of studying the life and habits of these animals.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>All writers on the subject of Alaskan exploration and enterprise
agree as to the cause of the discovery of the Pribylov Islands in the
last century. It was due to the feverish anxiety of a handful of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
Russian fur-gatherers, who desired to find new fields of gain when
they had exhausted those last uncovered. Altasov and his band of
Russians, Tartars, and Cossacks arrived at Kamtchatka toward the
end of the seventeenth century, and they were the first discoverers
of the beautiful, costly fur of the sea-otter. The animal bearing
this pelage abounded then on that coast, but by the middle of the
eighteenth century they and those who came after them had entirely
extirpated it from that country. Then the survivors of Bering’s
second voyage of observation, in 1741-42, and Tschericov
brought back an enormous number of skins from Bering Island;
then Michael Novodiskov discovered Attoo and the contiguous
islands in 1745; Paicov came after him, and opened out the Fox
Islands, in the same chain, during 1759; then succeeded Stepan
Glottov, of infamous memory, who determined Kadiak in 1763; the
peninsula of Alaska was discovered by Krenitzin in 1768. During
these long years, from the discovery of Attoo until the last date mentioned
above, a great many Russian companies fitted out at the
mouth of the Amoor River and in the Okotsk Sea; they prospected
therefrom this whole Aleutian archipelago in search of the sea-otter.
There were, perhaps, twenty-five or thirty different companies, with
quite a fleet of small vessels; and so energetic and thorough were
they in their search and capture of the sea-otter that as early as
1772 and 1774 the catch in that group had dwindled from thousands
and tens of thousands at first to hundreds and tens of hundreds at
last. As all men do when they find that that which they are engaged
in is failing them, a change of search and inquiry was in
order; and, then the fur-seal, which had been noted, but not valued
much, every year as it went north in the spring through the passes
and channels of the Aleutian chain, then going back south again in
the fall, became the source of much speculation as to where it spent
its time on land and how it bred. No one had ever known of its
stopping one solitary hour on a single rock or beach throughout all
Alaska or the northwest coast. The natives, when questioned, expressed
themselves as entirely ignorant, though they believed, as
they believe in many things of which they have no knowledge, that
these seals repaired to some unknown land in the north every summer
and left it every winter. They also reasoned then, that when
they left the unknown land to the north in the fall, and went south
into the North Pacific, they travelled to some other strange island or
continent there, upon which in turn to spend the winter. Naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
the Russians preferred to look for the supposed winter resting-places
of the fur-seal, and forthwith a hundred schooners and shallops
sailed into storm and fog, to the northward occasionally, and
always to the southward, in search of this rumored breeding-ground.
Indeed, if the record can be credited, the whole bent of this
Russian attention and search for the fur-seal islands was devoted
to that region south of the Aleutian Islands, between Japan and
Oregon.</p>

<p>Hence it was not until 1786, after more than eighteen years of
unremitting search by hardy navigators, that the Pribylov Islands
were discovered. It seems that a rugged Muscovitic “stoorman,”
or ship’s “mate,” Gerassim Pribylov by name, serving under the
direction and in the pay of one of the many companies engaged in
the fur-business at that time, was much moved and exercised in his
mind by the revelations of an old Aleutian shaman at Oonalashka,
who pretended to recite a legend of the natives, wherein he declared
that certain islands in Bering Sea had long been known to
the Aleutes.</p>

<p>Pribylov<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> commanded a small sloop, the <em>St. George</em>, which
he employed for three successive years in constant, though fruitless,
explorations to the northward of Oonalashka and Oonimak,
ranging over the whole of Bering Sea from the straits above. His
ill-success does not now seem strange as we understand the currents,
the winds, and fogs of those waters. Why, only recently the
writer himself has been on one of the best-manned vessels that ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
sailed from any port, provided with good charts and equipped with
all the marine machinery known to navigation, and that vessel has
hovered for nine successive days off the north point and around
St. Paul Island, sometimes almost on the reef, and never more
than ten miles away, without actually knowing where the island
was! So Pribylov did well, considering, when at the beginning of
the third summer’s tedious search, in July, 1786, his old sloop ran
up against the walls of Tolstoi Mees, at St. George, and, though
the fog was so thick that he could see scarce the length of his vessel,
his ears were regaled by the sweet music of seal-rookeries
wafted out to him on the heavy air. He knew then that he had
found the object of his search, and he at once took possession of
the island in the Russian name and that of his craft.</p>

<p>His secret could not long be kept. He had left some of his
men behind him to hold the island, and when he returned to Oonalashka
they were gone; and ere the next season fairly opened, a
dozen vessels were watching him and trimming in his wake. Of
course, they all found the island, and in that year, July, 1787, the
sailors of Pribylov, on St. George, while climbing the bluffs and
straining their eyes for a relief-ship, descried the low coast and
scattered cones of St. Paul, thirty-six miles to the northwest of
them. When they landed at St. George, not a sign or a vestige of
human habitation was found thereon; but during the succeeding
year, when they crossed over to St. Paul and took possession of
it, in turn, they were surprised at finding on the south coast of
that island, at a point now known as English Bay, the remains of a
recent fire. There were charred embers of drift-wood and places
where grass had been scorched; there was a pipe and a brass knife-handle,
which, I regret to say, have long passed beyond the cognizance
of any ethnologist. This much appears in the Russian
records.</p>

<p>But, if we can believe the Aleutes in what they relate, the islands
were known to them long before they were visited by the Russians.
They knew and called them “Ateek,” after having heard about
them. The legend of these people was as follows:</p>

<p>Eegad-dah-geek, a son of an Oonimak chief of the name of Ah-kak-nee-kak,
was taken out to sea in a bidarka by a storm, the
wind blowing strong from the south. He could not get back to
the beach, nor could he make any other landing, and was obliged
to run before the wind three or four days, when he brought up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
on St. Paul Island, north from the land which he had been compelled
to leave. Here he remained until autumn, and became acquainted
with the hunting of different animals. Elegant weather
one day setting in, he saw the peaks of Oonimak. He then resolved
to put to sea, and return to receive the thanks of his people
there, and after three or four days of travelling he arrived at Oonimak
with “many otter tails and snouts.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>The Pribylov Islands lie in the heart of Bering Sea, and are
among the most insignificant landmarks known to that ocean.
They are situated one hundred and ninety-two miles north of Oonalashka,
two hundred miles south of St. Matthews, and about the
same distance westward of Cape Newenham on the mainland.</p>

<p>The islands of St. George and St. Paul are from twenty-seven
to thirty miles apart, St. George lying southeastward of St. Paul.
They are far enough south to be beyond the reach of permanent
ice-floes, upon which polar bears would have made their way to the
islands, though a few of these animals were doubtless always present.
They were also distant enough from the inhabited Aleutian
districts and the coast of the mainland to have remained unknown
to savage men. Hence they afforded the fur-seal the happiest
shelter and isolation, for their position seems to be such as to
surround and envelop them with fog-banks that fairly shut out the
sun nine days in every ten during the summer and breeding-season.</p>

<p>In this location ocean-currents from the great Pacific, warmer
than the normal temperature of this latitude, trending up from
southward, ebb and flow around the islands as they pass, giving rise
during the summer and early autumn to constant, dense, humid
fog and drizzling mists, which hang in heavy banks over the ground
and the sea-line, seldom dissolving away to indicate a pleasant day.
By the middle or end of October strong, cold winds, refrigerated
on the Siberian steppes, sweep down over the islands, carrying off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
the moisture and clearing up the air. By the end of January, or
early in February, they usually bring, by their steady pressure,
from the north and northwest, great fields of broken ice, sludgy
floes, with nothing in them approximating or approaching glacial
ice. They are not very heavy or thick, but as the wind blows they
compactly cover the whole surface of the sea, completely shutting
in the land, and for months at a time hush the wonted roar of the
surf. In the exceptionally cold seasons that succeed each other up
there every four or five years, for periods of three and even four
months—from December to May, and sometimes into June—the
islands will be completely environed and ice-bound. On the other
hand, in about the same rotation, occur exceptionally mild winters.
Not even the sight of an ice-blink is recorded then during the whole
winter, and there is very little skating on the shallow lakes and
lagoons peculiar to St. Paul and St. George. This, however, is not
often the case.</p>

<p>The breaking up of winter-weather and the precipitation of
summer (for there is no real spring or autumn in these latitudes),
usually commences about the first week in April. The ice begins
to leave or dissolve at that time, or a little later, so that by the 1st
or 5th of May, the beaches and rocky sea-margin beneath the mural
precipices are generally clear and free from ice and snow, although
the latter occasionally lies, until the end of July or the middle of
August, in gullies and on leeward hill-slopes, where it has drifted
during the winter. Fog, thick and heavy, rolls up from the sea, and
closes over the land about the end of May. This, the habitual sign
of summer, holds on steadily to the middle or end of October again.</p>

<p>The periods of change in climate are exceedingly irregular
during the autumn and spring, so-called, but in summer a cool,
moist, shady gray fog is constantly present. To this certainty of
favored climate, coupled with the perfect isolation and an exceeding
fitness of the ground, is due, without doubt, that preference
manifested by the warm-blooded animals which come here every
year, in thousands and hundreds of thousands to breed, to the
practical exclusion of all other ground.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>I simply remark here, that the winter which I passed upon St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
Paul Island (1872-73) was one of great severity, and, according
to the natives, such as is very seldom experienced. Cold as it was,
however, the lowest marking of the thermometer was only 12° Fahr.
below zero, and that lasted but a few hours during a single day
in February, while the mean of that month was 18° above. I found
that March was the coldest month. Then the mean was 12° above,
and I have since learned that March continues to be the meanest
month of the year. The lowest average of a usual winter ranges
from 22° to 26° above zero; but these quiet figures are simply inadequate
to impress the reader with this exceeding discomfort of
a winter in that locality. It is the wind that tortures and cripples
out-door exercise there, as it does on all the sea-coasts and islands
of Alaska. It is blowing, blowing, from every point of the compass
at all times; it is an everlasting succession of furious gales, laden
with snow and sleety spiculæ, whirling in great drifts to-day, while
to-morrow the wind will blow from a quarter directly opposite, and
reverse its drift-building action of the day preceding.</p>

<p>Without being cold enough to suffer, one is literally confined
and chained to his room from December until April by this Æolian
tension. I remember very well that, during the winter of 1872-73,
I was watching, with all the impatience which a man in full health
and tired of confinement can possess, every opportunity to seize
upon quiet intervals between the storms, in which I could make
short trips along those tracks over which I was habituated to walk
during the summer; but in all that hyemal season I got out but
three times, and then only by the exertion of great physical energy.
On a day in March, for example, the velocity of the wind at St.
Paul, recorded by one of the signal-service anemometers, was at the
rate of eighty-eight miles per hour, with as low a temperature as
-4°! This particular wind-storm, with snow, blew at such a velocity
for six days without an hour’s cessation, while the natives passed
from house to house crawling on all fours. No man could stand up
against it, and no man wanted to. At a much higher temperature—say
at 15° or 16° above zero—with the wind blowing only twenty
or twenty-five miles an hour, it is necessary, when journeying, to
be most thoroughly wrapped up so as to guard against freezing.</p>

<p>As I have said, there are here virtually but two seasons—winter
and summer. To the former belongs November and the following
months up to the end of April, with a mean temperature of 20° to
28°; while the transition of summer is but a very slight elevation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
of that temperature, not more than 15° or 20°. Of the summer
months, July, perhaps, is the warmest, with an average temperature
between 46° and 50° in ordinary seasons. When the sun breaks out
through the fog, and bathes the dripping, water-soaked hills and
flats of the island in its hot flood of light, I have known the thermometer
to rise to 60° and 64° in the shade, while the natives
crawled out of that fervent and unwonted heat, anathematizing its
brilliancy and potency. Sunshine does them no good; for, like the
seals, they seem under its influence to swell up at the neck. A
little of it suffices handsomely for both Aleutes and pinnipedia, to
whom the ordinary atmosphere is much more agreeable.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how rapidly snow melts here. This is due,
probably, to the saline character of the air, for when the temperature
is only a single degree above freezing, and after several successive
days in April or May, at 34° and 36°, grass begins to grow,
even if it be under melting drifts, and the frost has penetrated the
ground many feet below. I have said that this humidity and fog,
so strongly and peculiarly characteristic of the Pribylov group, was
due to the warmer ocean-currents setting up from the coast of
Japan, trending to the Arctic through Bering’s Straits, and deflected
to the southward into the North Pacific, laving, as it flows,
the numerous passes and channels of the great Aleutian chain; but
I do not think, nor do I wish to be understood as saying, that my
observation in this respect warrants any conclusion as to so large a
Gulf Stream flowing to the north, such as mariners and hydrographers
recognize upon the Atlantic coast. I do not believe that
there is anything of the kind equal to it in Bering Sea. I believe,
however, that there is a steady set up to the northward from southward
around the Seal Islands, which is continued through Bering’s
Straits, and drifts steadily off up to the northeast, until it is lost
beyond Point Barrow. That this pelagic circulation exists, is
clearly proven by the logs of the whalers, who, from 1845 to 1856,
literally filled the air over those waters with the smoke of their
“try-fires,” and ploughed every square rod of that superficial marine
area with their adventurous keels. While no two, perhaps, of those
old whaling captains living to-day will agree as to the exact course
of tides,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> for Alaskan tides do not seem to obey any law, they all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
affirm the existence of a steady current, passing up from the south
to the northeast, through Bering’s Straits. The flow is not rapid,
and is doubtless checked at times, for short intervals, by other
causes, which need not be discussed here. It is certain, however,
that there is warm water enough, abnormal to the latitude, for the
evolution of those characteristic fog-banks, which almost discomfited
Pribylov, at the time of his discovery of the islands, nearly one hundred
years ago, and which have remained ever since.</p>

<p>Without this fog the fur-seal would never have rested there as
he has done; but when he came on his voyage of discovery, ages
ago, up from the rocky coasts of Patagonia mayhap, had he not
found this cool, moist temperature of St. Paul and St. George, he
would have kept on, completed the circuit, and returned to those
congenial antipodes of his birth.</p>

<p>Speaking of the stormy weather brings to my mind the beautiful,
varied, and impressive nephelogical display in the heavens overhead
here during October and November. I may say, without exaggeration,
that the cloud-effects which I have witnessed from the
bluffs of this little island, at this season of the year, surpass anything
that I had ever seen before. Perhaps the mighty masses of
cumuli, deriving their origin from warm exhalations out of the sea,
and swelled and whirled with such rapidity, in spite of their appearance
of solidity, across the horizon, owe their striking brilliancy of
color and prismatic tones to that low declination of the sun due to
the latitude. Whatever the cause may be, and this is not the place
to discuss it, certainly no other spot on earth can boast of a more
striking and brilliant cloud-display. In the season of 1865-66,
when I was encamped on this same parallel of latitude in the mountains
eastward of Sitka and the interior, I was particularly attracted
by an exceeding brilliancy, persistency, and activity of the aurora;
but here on St. Paul, though I eagerly looked for its dancing light,
it seldom appeared; and when it did it was a sad disappointment,
the exhibition always being insignificant as compared in my
mind with its flashing of my previous experience. A quaint old
writer, a hundred years ago, was describing Norway and its people:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
he advanced what he considered a very plausible theory
for the cause of the aurora; he cited an ancient sage, who believed
that the change of winds threw the saline particles of the
sea high into the air, and then by aërial friction, “fermentation”
took place, and the light was evolved! I am sure that the saline
particles of Bering Sea were whirled into the air during the whole
of that winter of my residence there, but no “fermentation” occurred,
evidently, since rarely indeed did the aurora greet my eyes.
In the summer season there is considerable lightning; you will see
it streak its zigzag path mornings, evenings, and even noondays, but
from the dark clouds and their swelling masses upon which it is
portrayed no sound returns—a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fulmen brutum</i>, in fact. I remember
hearing but one clap of thunder while in that country. If I recollect
aright, and my Russian served me well, one of the old natives
told me that it was no mystery, this light of the aurora, for, said he,
“we all believe that there are fire-mountains away up toward the
north, and what we see comes from their burning throats, mirrored
back on the heavens.”</p>

<p>The formation of these islands, St. Paul and St. George, was
recent, geologically speaking, and directly due to volcanic agency,
which lifted them abruptly, though gradually, from the sea-bed.
Little spouting craters then actively poured out cinders and other
volcanic breccia upon the table-bed of basalt, depositing below as
well as above the water’s level as they rose; and subsequently finishing
their work of construction through the agency of these
spout-holes or craters, from which water-puddled ashes and tufa
were thrown. Soon after the elevation and deposit of the igneous
matter, all active volcanic action must have ceased, though a few
half-smothered outbursts seem to have occurred very recently indeed,
for on Bobrovia or Otter Island, six miles southward of St.
Paul, is the fresh, clearly blown-out throat, with the fire-scorched
and smoked, smooth, sharp-cut, funnel-like walls of a crater. This
is the only place on the Seal Islands where there are any evidences
of recent discharges from the crater of a volcano.</p>

<p>Since the period of the upheaval of the group under discussion,
the sea has done much to modify and even enlarge the most important
one, St. Paul, while the others, St. George and Otter, being
lifted abruptly above the power of water and ice to carry and
deposit sand, soil, and boulders, are but little changed from the
condition of their first appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>The Russians tell a somewhat strange story in connection with
Pribylov’s landing. They say that both the islands were at first
without vegetation, save St. Paul, where there was a small “talneek,”
or willow, creeping along on the ground; and that on St. George
nothing grew, not even grass, except on the place where the carcasses
of dead animals rotted. Then, in the course of time, both
islands became covered with grass, a great part of it being of the
sedge kind, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elymus</i>. This record of Veniaminov, however, is
scarcely credible; there are few, surely, who will not question the
opinion that the seals antedated the vegetation, for, according to his
own statements, these creatures were there then in the same immense
numbers that we find them to-day. The vegetation on these
islands, such as it is, is fresh and luxuriant during the growing season
of June and July and early August, but the beauty and economic
value of trees and shrubbery, of cereals and vegetables, are
denied to them by climatic conditions. Still I am strongly inclined
to believe that, should some of those hardy shrubs and spruce trees
indigenous at Sitka or Kadiak, be transplanted properly to any of
the southern hill-slopes of St. Paul most favored by soil, drainage,
and bluffs, for shelter from saline gales, they might grow, though I
know that, owing to the lack of sunlight, they would never mature
their seed. There is, however, during the summer, a beautiful
spread of grasses, of flowering annuals, biennials, and perennials, of
gayly-colored lichens and crinkled mosses,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> which have always afforded
me great delight whenever I have pressed my way over the
moors and up the hillsides of the rookeries.</p>

<p>There are ten or twelve species of grasses of every variety, from
close, curly, compact mats to tall stalks—tussocks of the wild
wheat, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elymus arenaria</i>, standing in favorable seasons waist high—the
“wheat of the north”—together with over one hundred varieties
of annuals, perennials, sphagnum, cryptogamic plants, etc., all
flourishing in their respective positions, and covering nearly every
point of rock, tufa, cement, and sand that a plant can grow upon,
with a living coat of the greenest of all greens—for there is not
sunlight enough there to ripen any perceptible tinge of ochre-yellow
into it—so green that it gives a deep blue tint to gray noonday
shadows, contrasting pleasantly with the varying russets, reds,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>lemon-yellows, and grays of the lichen-covered rocks, and the
brownish-purple of the wild wheat on the sand-dune tracts in
autumn, together, also, with innumerable blue, yellow, pink, and
white phænogamous blossoms, everywhere interspersed over the
grassy uplands and sandy flats. Occasionally, on looking into the
thickest masses of verdure, our common wild violet will be found,
while the phloxes are especially bright and brilliant here. The
flowers of one species of gentian, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gentiana verna</i> are very marked
in their beauty; also those of a nasturtium, and a creeping pea-vine
on the sand-dunes. The blossom of a species of the pulse family
is the only one here that emits a positive, rich perfume; the
others are more suggestive of that quality than expressive. The
most striking plant in all of a long list is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Archangelica officinalis</i>,
with its tall seed-stalks and broad leaves, which grows first
in spring and keeps green latest in the fall. The luxuriant rhubarb-like
stems of this umbellifer, after they have made their rapid
growth in June, are eagerly sought for by the natives, who pull
them and crunch them between their teeth with all the relish that
we experience in eating celery. The exhibition of ferns at Kamminista,
St. Paul, during the summer of 1872, surpassed anything
that I ever saw: I recall with vivid detail the exceedingly fine display
made by these luxuriant and waving fronds, as they reared
themselves above the rough interstices of that rocky ridge. From
the fern roots, and those of the gentian, the natives here draw their
entire stock of vegetable medicines. This floral display on St. Paul
is very much more extensive and conspicuous than that on St.
George, owing to the absence of any noteworthy extent of warm
sand-dune country on the latter island.</p>

<p>When an unusually warm summer passes over the Pribylov
group, followed by an open fall and a mild winter, the elymus
ripens its seed, and stands like fields of uncut grain in many places
along the north shore of St. Paul and around the village, the snow
not falling enough to entirely obliterate it; but it is seldom allowed
to flourish to that extent. By the end of August and the first week
of September of normal seasons, the small edible berries of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empetrum
nigrum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rubus chamæmorus</i> are ripe. They are found in
considerable quantities, especially at “Zapadnie,” on both islands,
and, as everywhere else throughout circumpolar latitudes, the
former is small, watery, and dark, about the size of an English or
black currant; the other resembles an unripe and partially decayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
raspberry. They are, however, keenly relished by the natives, and
even by American residents, being the only fruit growing upon
the islands. Perhaps no one plant that flowers on the Seal Islands
is more conspicuous and abundant than is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saxifraga oppositofolia</i>;
it grows over all localities, rank and tall in rich locations, to
stems scarcely one inch high on the thin, poor soil of hill summits
and sides, densely cespitose, with leaves all imbricated in four rows;
and flowers almost sessile. I think that at least ten well-defined
species of the order <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saxifragaceæ</i> exist on the Pribylov group.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ranunculaceæ</i> are not so numerous; but, still, a buttercup growing
in every low slope where you may chance to wander is always
a pleasant reminder of pastures at home; and, also, a suggestion
of the farm is constantly made by the luxuriant inflorescence of the
wild mustard (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cruciferæ</i>). The chickweeds (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caryophyllaceæ</i>) are
well represented, and also the familiar yellow dandelion, Taraxacum
palustre. Many lichens (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lichenes</i>) and soft mosses (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Musci</i>) are in
their greatest exuberance, variety, and beauty here; and myriads
of golden poppies (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Papaveraceæ</i>) are nodding their graceful heads
in the sweeping of the winds—the first flowers to bloom, and the
last to fade.</p>

<p>The chief economic value rendered by the botany of the Pribylov
Islands to the natives is an abundance of the basket-making rushes
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Juncaceæ</i>), which the old “barbies” gather in the margins of
many of the lakes and pools.</p>

<p>The only suggestion of a tree<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> found growing on the Pribylov<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
group is the hardy “talneek” or creeping willow; there are three
species of the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salix</i> found here, viz., <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reticulata</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">polaris</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arctica</i>; the first named is the most common and of largest growth;
it progresses exactly as a cucumber-vine does in our gardens; as
soon as it has made from the seed a growth of six inches or a foot
upright from the soil, then it droops over and crawls along prostrate
upon the earth, rocks, and sphagnum; some of the largest talneek
trunks will measure eight or ten feet in decumbent length
along the ground, and are as large around the stump as an average
wrist of man. The usual size, however, is very, very much less;
while the stems of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">polaris</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arctica</i> scarcely ever reach the diameter
of a pencil case, or the procumbent length of two feet.</p>

<p>Although <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rubus chamæmorus</i> is a tree-shrub, and is found here
very commonly distributed, yet it grows such a slender diminutive
bush, that it gives no thought whatever of its being anything of
the sort. Herbs, grasses, and ferns tower above it on all sides.</p>

<p>The fungoid growths on the Pribylov Islands are abundant and
varied, especially in and around the vicinity of the rookeries and
the killing-grounds. On the west slope of the Black bluffs at St.
Paul the mushroom, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agaricus campestris</i>, was gathered in the season
of 1872 by the natives, and eaten by one or two families in the
village, who had learned to cook them nicely from the Russians.
These Seal Island mushrooms have deeper tones of pink and purple-red
in their gills than do those of my gathering in the States. I
kicked over many large spherical “puff-balls” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lycoperdæ</i>) in my
tundra walks; myriads of smaller ones (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lycoperdon cinereum?</i>) cover
patches near the spots where carcasses have long since rotted, together
with a pale gray fungus (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agaricus fimiputris</i>), exceedingly
delicate and frosted exquisitely. Some ligneous fungi (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clavaria</i>),
will be found attached to the decaying stems of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salix reticulata</i>
(creeping willows). The irregularity of the annual growing of the
agarics, and their rapid growth when they do appear, makes their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
determination excessively difficult; they are as unstable in their
visits as are several of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepidoptera</i>. The cool humidity of climate
during the summer season on the Pribylov Islands is especially
adapted to that mysterious, but beautiful growth of these
plants—the apotheosis of decay. The coloring of several varieties
is very bright and attractive, shading from a purplish-scarlet to a
pallid white.</p>

<p>A great many attempts have been made, both here and at St.
George, to raise a few of the hardy vegetables. With the exception
of growing lettuce, turnips, and radishes on the Island of St.
Paul, nothing has been or can be done. On the south shore of St.
George, and at the foot of a mural bluff, is a little patch of ground
less in area than one-sixteenth of an acre, which appears to be so
drained and so warmed by the rarely-reflected sunlight from this
cliff, every ray of which seems to be gathered and radiated from the
rocks, as to allow the production of fair turnips; and at one season
there were actually raised potatoes as large as walnuts. Gardening,
however, on either island involves so much labor and so much care,
with so poor a return, that it has been discontinued. It is a great
deal better, and a great deal easier, to have the “truck” come up
once a year from San Francisco on the steamer.</p>

<p>There is one comfort which nature has vouchsafed to civilized
man on these islands. There are very few indigenous insects. A
large flesh-fly, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombylius major</i>, appears during the summer and
settles in a striking manner on the backs of quiet, loafing natives,
or strings itself in rows of millions upon the long grass-blades
which flourish about the killing-grounds, especially on the leaf-stalks
of an elymus, causing this vegetation, over the whole slaughtering-field
and vicinity, to fairly droop to earth as if beaten down by a
tornado of wind and rain. It makes the landscape look as though
it had moulded over night, and the fungoid spores were blue and
gray. Our common house-fly is not present; I never saw one while
I was up there. The flesh-flies which I have just mentioned never
came into the dwellings unless by accident: the natives say they do
not annoy them, and I did not notice any disturbance among the
few animals which the resident company had imported for beef and
for service.</p>

<p>Then, again, this is perhaps the only place in all Alaska where
man, primitive and civilized, is not cursed by mosquitoes. There
are none here. A gnat, that is disagreeably suggestive of the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
enemy just referred to, flits about in large swarms, but it is inoffensive,
and seeks shelter in the grass. Several species of beetles are
also numerous here. One of them, the famous green and gold
“carabus,” is exceedingly common, crawling everywhere, and is
just as bright in the rich bronzing of its wing-shields as are its
famous prototypes of Brazil. One or two species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Itemosa</i>, a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cymindis</i>, several representatives of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aphidiphaga</i>, one or two of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dytiscidæ</i>, three or four <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cicindelidæ</i>—these are nearly all that I
found. A single dragon-fly, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Perla bicaudata</i>, flitted over the lakes
and ponds of St Paul. The familiar form to our eyes, of the bumble-bee,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombus borealis</i>, passing from flower to flower, was rarely
seen; but a few are here resident. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydrocorisæ</i> occur in great
abundance, skipping over the water in the lakes and pools everywhere,
and a very few species of butterflies, principally the yellow
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nymphalidæ</i>, are represented by numerous individuals.</p>

<p>Aside from the seal-life on the Pribylov Islands, there is no indigenous
mammalian creature, with the exception of the blue and
white foxes, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vulpes lagopus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and a lemming, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myodes obensis</i>. The
latter is restricted, for some reason or other, to the Island of St.
George, where it is, or at least was, in 1874, very abundant. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
burrows and paths, under and among the grassy hummocks and
mossy flats, checkered every square rod of land there covered with
this vegetation. Although the Island of St. Paul is but twenty-nine
or thirty miles to the northwest, not a single one of these active,
curious little animals is found there, nor could I learn from the
natives that it had ever been seen there. The foxes are also restricted
to these islands; that is, their kind, which are not found
elsewhere, except the stray examples on St. Matthew seen by myself,
and those which are carefully domesticated and preserved at
Attoo, the extreme westernmost land of the Aleutian chain. These
animals find comfortable holes for their accommodation and retreat
on the Seal Islands, among the countless chinks and crevices of the
basaltic formation. They feed and grow fat upon sick and weakly
seals, also devouring many of the pups, and they vary this diet by
water-fowl and eggs<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> during the summer, returning for their subsistence
during the long winter to the bodies of seals upon the
breeding-grounds and the skinned carcasses left upon the killing-fields.
Were they not regularly hunted from December until April,
when their fur is in its prime beauty and condition, they would
swarm like the lemming on St. George, and perhaps would soon be
obliged to eat one another. The natives, however, thin them out
by incessant trapping and shooting during the period when the
seals are away from the islands.</p>

<p>The Pribylov group is as yet free from rats; at least none have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
got off from the ships. There is no harbor on either of these
islands, and vessels lie out in the roadstead, so far from land that
those pests do not venture to swim to the shore. Mice were long
ago brought to shore in ships’ cargoes, and they are a great nuisance
to the white people as well as the natives throughout the
islands. Hence cats also are abundant. Nowhere, perhaps, in the
wide world are such cats to be seen as these. The tabby of our
acquaintance, when she goes up there and lives upon the seal-meat
spread everywhere under her nose, is metamorphosed, by time of
the second generation, into a stubby feline ball. In other words,
she becomes thickened, short, and loses part of the normal length
of her tail; also her voice is prolonged and resonant far beyond the
misery which she inflicts upon our ears here. These cats actually
swarm about the natives’ houses, never in them much, for only a
tithe of their whole number can be made pets of; but they do make
night hideous beyond all description. They repair for shelter often
to the chinks of precipices and bluffs; but although not exactly
wild, yet they cannot be approached or cajoled. The natives, when
their sluggish wits are periodically aroused and thoroughly disturbed
by the volume of cat-calls in their village, sally out and by a
vigorous effort abate the nuisance for the time being. Only the
most fiendish caterwauling will or can arouse this Aleutian ire.</p>

<p>On account of the severe climatic conditions it is, of course, impracticable
to keep stock here with any profit or pleasure. The
experiment has been tried faithfully. It is found best to bring
beef-cattle up in the spring on the steamer, turn them out to pasture
until the close of the season in October and November, and
then, if the snow comes, to kill them and keep the carcasses refrigerated
until consumed. Stock cannot be profitably raised here; the
proportion of severe weather annually is too great. From three to
perhaps six months of every year they require feeding and watering,
with good shelter. To furnish an animal with hay and grain
up there is a costly matter, and the dampness of the growing summer
season on both islands renders hay-making impracticable.
Perhaps a few head of hardy Siberian cattle might pick up a living
on the north shore of St Paul, among the grasses and sand-dunes
there, with nothing more than shelter and water given them; but
they would need both of these attentions. Then the care of them
would hardly return expenses, as the entire grazing-ground could
not support any number of animals. It is less than two square<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
miles in extent, and half of this area is unproductive. Then, too,
a struggle for existence would reduce the flesh and vitality of these
cattle to so low an ebb that it is doubtful whether they could be
put through another winter alive, especially if severe. I was then
and am now strongly inclined to think that if a few of those Siberian
reindeer could be brought over to St. Paul and to St. George
they would make a very successful struggle for existence, and be
a source of a good supply, summer and winter, of fresh meat for
the agents of the Government and the company who may be living
upon the islands. I do not think that they would be inclined to
molest or visit the seal-grounds; at least, I noticed that the cattle
and mules of the company running loose on St. Paul were careful
never to poke around on the outskirts of a rookery, and deer would
be more timid and less obtrusive than our domesticated animals.
But I did notice on St. George that a little squad of sheep, brought
up and turned out there for a summer’s feeding, seemed to be so
attracted by the quiet calls of the pups on the rookeries that they
were drawn to and remained by the seals without disturbing them
at all, to their own physical detriment, for they lost better pasturage
by so doing. The natives of St. Paul have a strange passion
for seal-fed pork, and there are quite a large number of pigs on
the Island of St. Paul and a few on St. George. Such hogs soon
become entirely carnivorous, living, to the practical exclusion of all
other diet, on the carcasses of seals.</p>

<p>Chickens are kept with great difficulty. In fact, it is only possible
to save their lives when the natives take them into their own
rooms or keep them over their heads, in their dwellings, during
winter.</p>

<p>While the great exhibition of pinnipedia preponderates over
every other feature of animal life at the Seal Islands, still there is a
wonderful aggregate of ornithological representation thereon. The
spectacle of birds nesting and breeding, as they do on St. George
Island, to the number of millions, flecking those high basaltic bluffs
of its shore-line, twenty-nine miles in length, with color-patches of
black, brown, and white, as they perch or cling to the mural cliffs
in the labor of incubation, is a sight of exceeding attraction and
constant novelty. It affords a naturalist an opportunity of a lifetime
for minute investigation into all the details of the reproduction
of these vast flocks of circumboreal water-fowl. The Island of
St. Paul, owing to the low character of its shore-line, a large proportion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>of which is but slightly elevated above the sea and is sandy,
is not visited and cannot be visited by such myriads of birds as are
seen at St. George; but the small rocky Walrus Islet is fairly covered
with sea-fowls, and the Otter Island bluffs are crowded by
them to their utmost capacity of reception. The birds string themselves
anew around the bluffs with every succeeding season, like
endless ribbons stretched across their rugged faces, while their
numbers are simply countless. The variety is not great, however,
in these millions of breeding-birds. It consists of only ten or
twelve names, and the whole list of birds belonging to the Pribylov
Islands, stragglers and migratory, contains but forty species. Conspicuous
among the last-named class is the robin, a straggler which
was brought from the mainland, evidently against its own effort, by
a storm or a gale of wind, which also brings against their will the
solitary hawks, owls, and waders occasionally noticed here.</p>

<p>After the dead silence of a long ice-bound winter, the arrival of
large flocks of those sparrows of the north, the “choochkies,” <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phaleris
microceros</i>, is most cheerful and interesting. These plump
little auks are bright, fearless, vivacious birds, with bodies round
and fat. They come usually in chattering flocks on or immediately
after May 1st, and are caught by the people with hand-scoops or
dip-nets to any number that may be required for the day’s consumption,
their tiny, rotund forms making pies of rare savory virtue,
and being also baked and roasted and stewed in every conceivable
shape by skilful cooks. Indeed, they are equal to the
reed-birds of the South. These welcome visitors are succeeded
along about July 20th by large flocks of fat, red-legged turn-stones,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Strepsilas interpres</i>, which come in suddenly from the west or north,
where they have been breeding, and stop on the islands for a month
or six weeks, as the case may be, to feed luxuriantly upon the flesh-flies,
which we have just noticed, and their eggs. These handsome
birds go in among the seals, familiarly chasing the flies, gnats, etc.
They are followed as they leave in September by several species of
jack-snipe and a plover, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tringa</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Charadrius</i>. These, however,
soon depart, as early as the end of October and the beginning of
November, and then winter fairly closes in upon the islands. The
loud, roaring, incessant seal-din, together with the screams and
darkening flight of innumerable water-fowl, are replaced in turn
again by absolute silence, marking out, as it were, in lines of sharp
and vivid contrast, summer’s life and winter’s death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>The author of that quaint old saying, “Birds of a feather flock
together,” might well have gained his inspiration had he stood
under the high bluffs of St. George at any season, prehistoric or
present, during the breeding of the water-birds there, where
myriads of croaking murres and flocks of screaming gulls darken
the light of day with their fluttering forms, and deafen the ear with
their shrill, harsh cries as they do now, for music is denied to all
those birds of the sea. Still, in spite of the apparent confusion, he
would have taken cognizance of the fact that each species had its
particular location and kept to its own boundary, according to the
precision of natural law. The dreary expanse and lonely solitudes
of the North owe their chief enlivenment, and their principal attractiveness
for man, to the presence of those vast flocks of circumboreal
water-fowl, which repair thither annually.</p>

<p>Over fifteen miles of the bold, basaltic, bluff line of St. George
Island is fairly covered with nesting gulls (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rissa</i>) and “arries”
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Uria</i>), while down in the countless chinks and holes over the entire
surface of the north side of this island millions of “choochkies”
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Simorhyncus microceros</i>) breed, filling the air and darkening
the light of day with their cries and fluttering forms. On Walrus
Islet the nests of the great white gull of the north (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Larus glaucus</i>)
can be visited and inspected, as well as those of the sea-parrot or
puffin (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fratercula</i>), shags or cormorants (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Graculus</i>), and the red-legged
kittiwake (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Larus brevirostris</i>). These birds are accessible
on every side, can be reached, and afford the observer an unequalled
opportunity of taking due notice of them through the breeding-season
of their own, as it begins in May and continues until the
end of September.</p>

<p>Not one of the water-birds found on and around the islands is
exempted from a place in the native’s larder; even the delectable
“oreelie” are unhesitatingly eaten by the people, and indeed these
birds furnish, during the winter season in especial, an almost certain
source of supply for fresh meat. But the heart of the Aleut
swells to its greatest gastronomic happiness when he can repair, in
the months of June and July, to the basaltic cliffs of St. George, or
the lava table-bed of Walrus Islet, and lay his grimy hands on
the gayly-colored eggs of the “arrie” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lomvia arra</i>); and if he
were not the most improvident of men, instead of taking only
enough for the day, he would lay up a great store for the morrow,
but he never does. On the occasion of one visit, and my first one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
there, July 5, 1872, six men loaded a bidarrah at Walrus Islet,
capable of carrying four tons, exclusive of our crew, down to the
water’s edge with eggs, in less than three working hours.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>During winter months these birds are almost wholly absent,
especially so if ice-floes shall have closed in around the islands;
then there is nothing of the feathered kind save a stupid shag (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.
bicristatus</i>) as it clings to the leeward cliffs, or the great burgomaster
gull, which sweeps in circling flight high overhead; but,
early in May they begin to make their first appearance, and they
come up from the sea overnight, as it were, their chattering and
their harsh carolling waking the natives from slothful sleeping,
which, however, they gladly break, to seize their nets and live
life anew, as far as eating is concerned. The stress of severe
weather in the winter months, the driving of the snow “boorgas,”
and the floating ice-fields closing in to shut out the open water, are
cause enough for a disappearance of all water-fowl, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tem</i>.</p>

<p>Again, the timid traveller here is delighted; he has been relieved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
of the great Alaskan curse of mosquitoes: he also walks the
moors and hillsides secure in never finding a reptile of any sort
whatever—no snakes, no lizards, no toads or frogs—nothing of the
sort to be found on the Seal Islands.</p>

<p>Fish are scarce in the vicinity of these islands. Only a few representatives
of those families which can secrete themselves with rare
cunning are safe in visiting the Pribylovs in summer. Naturally
enough, the finny tribes avoid the seal-churned waters for at least
one hundred miles around. Among a few specimens, however, which
I collected, three or four species new to natural science were found,
and have since been named by experts in the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p2120_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

</figure>

<p>The presence of such great numbers of amphibian mammalia
about the waters during five or six months of every year renders
all fishing abortive, and unless expeditions are made seven or eight
miles at least from the land, unless you desire to catch large halibut,
it is a waste of time to cast your line over the gunwale of the
boat. The natives capture “poltoos” or halibut, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hippoglossus vulgaris</i>,
within two or three miles of the reef-point on St. Paul and
the south shore during July and August. After this season the
weather is usually so stormy and cold that fishermen venture no
more until the ensuing summer.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>With regard to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mollusca</i> of the Pribylov waters, the characteristic
forms of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Toxoglossata</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhachiglossata</i> peculiar to this
north latitude are most abundant; of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cephalopoda</i> I have seen
only a species of squid, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sepia</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loligo</i>. The clustering whelks (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Buccinum</i>)
literally conceal large areas of the boulders on the beaches
here and there. They are in immense numbers, and are crushed
under your foot at almost every step when you pass over long
reaches of rocky shingle at low tide. A few of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neptunea</i> are
found, and the live and dead shells of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Limacina</i> are in great abundance
wherever the floating kelp-beds afford them shelter.</p>

<p>On land a very large number of shells of the genera <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Succinea</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pupa</i> abound all over the islands. On the bluffs of St. George,
just over Garden Cove, I gathered a beautiful <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helix</i>.</p>

<p>The little fresh-water lakes and ponds contain a great quantity
of representatives of the characteristic genera <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Planorbis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melania</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Limnea</i>, and that pretty little bivalve, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyclas</i>.</p>

<p>Of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crustacea</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Annelidæ</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Echinodermata</i>, there is
abundant representation here. The sea-urchins, “repkie” of the
natives, are eagerly sought for at low tide and eaten raw by them.
The arctic sea-clam, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mya truncata</i>, is once in a long time found
here (it is the chief food of the walrus of Alaska), and the species
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mytilus</i>, the mussels, so abundant in the Aleutian archipelago,
are almost absent here at St. Paul and only sparingly found at St.
George. Frequently the natives have brought a dish of sea-urchins’
viscera for our table, offering it as a great delicacy. I do not think
any of us did more than to taste it. The native women are the
chief hunters for echinoidæ, and during the whole spring and summer
seasons they will be seen at both islands, wading in the pools
at low water, with their scanty skirts high up, eagerly laying possessive
hands upon every “bristling egg” that shows itself. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
vary this search by poking, with a short-handled hook, into holes
and rocky crevices for a small cottoid fish, which is also found here
at low water in this manner. Specimens of this cottoid which I
brought down declared themselves as representatives of a new departure
from all other recognized forms in which the sculpin is
known to sport; hence the name, generic and specific. The “sandcake,”
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">echinarachinus</i>, is also very common here.</p>

<p>By May 28th to the middle of June a fine table-crab, large, fat,
and sweet, with a light, brittle shell, is taken while it is skurrying
in and out of the lagoon as the tide ebbs and flows. It is the best-flavored
crustacean known to Alaskan waters. They are taken nowhere
else at St. Paul, and when on St. George I failed to see one.
I am not certain as to the accuracy of the season of running, viz.:
May 28th to June 15th, inasmuch as one of my little note-books
on which this date is recorded turns out to be missing at the present
writing, and I am obliged to give it from memory. The only
economic shell-fish which the islands afford is embodied in this
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chionoecetes opilio (?)</i>. The natives affirm an existence of mussels
here in abundance when the Pribylov group was first discovered;
but now only a small supply of inferior size and quality is to be
found.</p>

<p>With reference to the jelly-fishes, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medusæ</i>, which are so abundant
in the waters around these islands, their exceeding number and
variety and beauty startled and enchanted me. An enormous aggregate
of these creatures, some of them exquisitely delicate and
translucent, ride in and out of the lagoon at St. Paul when the
spring-tides flow and ebb. Myriads of them are annually stranded,
to decay on the sandy flats of this estuary.</p>

<p>As to sea-weeds, or mosses,—the extent, luxuriance, variety, and
beauty of the algæ forests of those waters of Bering Sea which
lave the coasts of the Pribylov Islands, call for more detail of description
than space in this volume will allow, since anything like a
fair presentation of the subject would require the reproduction of
my water-colored drawings. After all heavier gales, especially the
southeasters in October, if a naturalist will take the trouble to
walk the sand-beach between Lukannon and northeast point of St.
Paul Island, he will be rewarded by the memorable sight. He
will find thrown up by the surf a vast windrow of kelp along the
whole eight or ten miles of this walk—heaped, at some spots, nearly
as high as his head; the large trunks of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melanospermæ</i>, the small,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>but brilliant red and crimson fronds of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhodospermæ</i> interwoven
with the emerald-green leaves of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chlorospermæ</i>. The first-named
group is by far the most abundant, and upon its decaying,
fermenting brown and ochre heaps, he will see countless numbers
of a buccinoid whelk, and a limnaca, feeding as they bore or suck
out myriads of tiny holes in the leaf-fronds of the strong growing
species. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Actinia</i> or sea-anemones, together with asteroids or starfishes,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Discophoræ</i> or jelly-fishes, are also interwoven and heaped up
with the “kapoosta” or sea-cabbages just referred to; also, many
rosy “sea-squirts,” yellow “cucumbers,” and other forms of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Holothuridæ</i>.</p>

<p>On the old killing-fields, on those spots where the sloughing
carcasses of repeated seasons have so enriched the soil as to render
it like fire to most vegetation, a silken green <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Confervæ</i> grows luxuriantly.
This terrestrial algoid covering appears here and there,
on these grounds, like so many door-mats of pea-green wool. That
confervoid flourishes only on those spots where nothing but pure
decaying animal matter is found. An admixture of sand or earth
will always supplant it by raising up instead those strong growing
grasses which I have alluded to elsewhere, and which constitute the
chief botanical life of the killing-grounds.</p>

<p>In order that the reader can follow easily the narrative of that
remarkable life-system which is conducted by the fur-seal as it annually
rests and breeds upon the Pribylov group, I present a careful
chart of each island and the contiguous islets, which are the
only surveys ever made upon the ground. The reader will observe,
as he turns to these maps, the striking dissimilarity which exists between
them, not only in contour but in physical structure, the
Island of St. Paul being the largest in superficial area, and receiving
a vast majority of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinnipedia</i> that belong to both. As it
lies in Bering Sea to-day, this island is, in its greatest length, between
northeast and southwest points, thirteen miles, air-line; and
a little less than six at points of greatest width. It has a superficial
area of about thirty-three square miles, or twenty-one thousand
one hundred and twenty acres, of diversified, rough and rocky
uplands, rugged hills, and smooth, volcanic cones, which either set
down boldly to the sea or fade out into extensive wet and mossy
flats, passing at the sea-margins into dry, drifting, sand-dune tracts.
It has forty-two miles of shore-line, and of this coast sixteen and a
half miles are hauled over by fur-seals <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">en masse</i>. At the time of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
first upheaval above the sea, it doubtless presented the appearance
of ten or twelve small rocky, bluffy islets and points, upon some of
which were craters that vomited breccia and cinders, with little or
no lava overflowing. Active plutonic agency must have soon ceased
after this elevation, and then the sea round about commenced a
work which it is now engaged in—of building on to the skeleton
thus created; and it has progressed to-day so thoroughly and successfully
in its labor of sand-shifting, together with the aid of ice-floes,
in their action of grinding, lifting, and shoving, that nearly all
of these scattered islets within the present area of the island, and
marked by its bluffs and higher uplands, are completely bound together
by ropes of sand, changed into enduring bars and ridges of
water-worn boulders. These are raised above the highest tides by
winds that whirl the sand up, over and on them, as it dries out
from the wash of the surf and from the interstices of rocks, which
are lifted up and pushed by ice-fields.</p>

<p>The sand that plays so important a part in the formation of
the Island of St. Paul, and which is almost entirely wanting in and
around the others of this Pribylov group, is principally composed
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Foraminifera</i>, together with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diatomacea</i>, mixed in with a volcanic
base of fine comminuted black and reddish lavas and old friable
gray slates. It constitutes the chief beauty of the sea-shore here,
for it changes color like a chameleon, as it passes from wet to dry,
being a rich steely-black at the surf-margin and then drying out to
a soft purplish-brown and gray, succeeding to tints most delicate of
reddish and pale neutral, when warmed by the sun and drifting up
on to the higher ground with the wind. The sand-dune tracts on
this island are really attractive in the summer, especially so during
those rare days when the sun comes out, and the unwonted light
shimmers over them and the most luxuriant grass and variety of
beautiful flowers which exist in profusion thereon. In past time,
as these sand and boulder bars were forming on St. Paul Island,
they, in making across from islet to islet, enclosed small bodies of
sea-water. These have, by evaporation and time, by the flooding of
rains and annual melting of snow, become, nearly every one of
them, fresh; they are all, great and small, well shown on my map,
which locates quite a large area of pure water. In them, as I have
hinted, are no reptiles; but an exquisite species of a tiny fish<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> exists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
in the lagoon-estuary near the village, and the small pure-water
lakes of the natives just under the flanks of Telegraph Hill. The
Aleutes assured me that they had caught fish in the big lake toward
Northeast Point, when they lived in their old village out there;
but, I never succeeded in getting a single specimen. The waters of
these pools and ponds are fairly alive with vast numbers of minute
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rotifera</i>, which sport about in all of them wherever they are examined.
Many species of water-plants, pond-lilies, algæ, etc., are
found in those inland waters, especially in that large lake “Mee-sulk-mah-nee,”
which is very shallow.</p>

<p>The backbone of St. Paul, running directly east and west,
from shore to shore, between Polavina Point and Einahnuhto Hills,
constitutes the high land of that island: Polavina Sopka, an old
extinct cinder-crater, five hundred and fifty feet; Bogaslov, an
upheaved mass of splinted lava, six hundred feet; and the hills
frowning over the bluffs there, on the west shore, are also six hundred
feet in elevation above the sea. But the average height of the
upland between is not much over one hundred to one hundred and
fifty feet above water-level, rising here and there into little hills and
broad, rocky ridges, which are minutely sketched upon the map.
From the northern base of Polavina Sopka a long stretch of low
sand-flats extends, enclosing the great lake, and ending in a narrow
neck where it unites with Novastoshnah, or Northeast Point. Here
that volcanic nodule known as Hutchinson’s Hill, with its low,
gradual slopes, trending to the east and southward, makes a rocky
foundation secure and broad, upon which the great single rookery
of the island, the greatest in the world, undoubtedly, is located.
The natives say that when they first came to these islands Novastoshna
was an island by itself, to which they went in boats from
Vesolia Mista; and the lagoon now so tightly enclosed was then
an open harbor in which the ships of the old Russian Company
rode safely at anchor. To-day, no vessel drawing ten feet of water
can safely get nearer than half a mile of the village, or a mile from
this lagoon at low tide.</p>

<p>The total absence of a harbor at the Pribylov Islands is much
to be regretted. The village of St. Paul, as will be seen by reference
to the map, is so located as to command the best landings for
vessels that can be made during the prevalence of any and all
winds, except those from the south. From these there is no shelter
for ships, unless they run around to the north side, where they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
unable to hold practicable communication with the people or to
discharge. At St. George matters are still worse, for the prevailing
northerly, westerly, and easterly winds drive the boats away from
the village roadstead, and weeks often pass at either island, but
more frequently at the latter, ere a cargo is landed at its destination.
Under the very best circumstances, it is both hazardous and
trying to unload a ship at any of these places. The approach to St.
Paul by water during thick weather is doubtful and dangerous, for
the land is mostly low at the coast, and the fogs hang so dense and
heavy over and around the hills as to completely obliterate their
presence from vision. The captain fairly feels his way in by throwing
his lead-line and straining his ear to catch the muffled roar of
the seal-rookeries, which are easily detected when once understood,
high above the booming of the surf. At St. George, however, the
bold, abrupt, bluffy coast everywhere all around, with its circling
girdle of flying water-birds far out to sea, looms up quite prominently,
even in the fog; or, in other words, the navigator can
notice it before he is hard aground or struggling to haul to windward
from the breakers under his lee. There are no reefs making
out from St. George worthy of notice, but there are several very
dangerous and extended ones peculiar to St. Paul, which Captain
John G. Baker, in command of the vessel<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> under my direction,
carefully sounded out, and which I have placed upon my chart for
the guidance of those who may sail in my wake hereafter.</p>

<p>When the wind blows from the north, northwest, and west to
southwest, the company’s steamer drops her anchor in eight fathoms
of water abreast of the black bluffs opposite the village, from
which anchorage her stores are lightered ashore; but in the northeasterly,
easterly, and southeasterly winds, she hauls around to the
lagoon bay west of the village, and there, little less than half a
mile from the landing, she drops her anchor in nine fathoms of
water, and makes considerable headway at discharging her cargo.
Sailing-craft come to both anchorages, but, however, keep still
farther out, though they choose relatively the same positions, yet
seek deeper water to swing to their cables in: the holding-ground
is excellent. At St. George the steamer comes, wind permitting,
directly to the village on the north shore, close up, and finds her
anchorage in ten fathoms of water, over poor holding-ground; still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
it is only when three or four days have passed, free from northerly,
westerly, or easterly winds that she can make the first attempt to
safely unload. The landing here is a very bad one, surf breaking
most violently upon the rocks from one end of the year to the
other.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">[<em>The North Store and landing, viewed from St. Paul.</em>]</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The observer will notice that six miles southward and westward
of the reef of St. Paul Island is a bluffy islet, called by the Russians
Bobrovia, because in olden time the promishlyniks are said
to have captured many thousands of sea-otters on its rocky coast.
It rises from the ocean, sheer and bold, an unbroken mural precipice
extending nearly all around, of sea-front, but dropping on its
northern margin, at the water, low, and slightly elevated above the
surf-wash, with a broken, rocky beach and no sand. The height of
the bluffs at their greatest elevation over the west end is three hundred
feet, while the eastern extremity is quite low, and terminated
by a queer, funnel-shaped crater-hill, which is as distinctly defined,
and as plainly scorched and devoid of the slightest sign of vegetation
within as though it had burned up and out yesterday. That
crater-point on Otter Island is the only unique feature of the place,
for with the exception of this low north shore, before mentioned,
where a few thousand of “bachelor seals” haul out during the
season every year, there is nothing else worthy of notice concerning
it. A bad reef makes out to the westward, which I have indicated
from my observation of the rocks awash, looking down upon
them from the bluffs. Great numbers of water-fowl roost upon
the cliffs, and there are here about as many blue foxes to the acre
as the law of life allows. A small, shallow pool of impure water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
lies close down to the north shore, right under a low hill upon which
the Russians in olden times posted a huge Greek cross, that is still
standing; indeed it was the habit of those early days of occupation
in Alaska to erect such monuments everywhere on conspicuous
elevations adjacent to the posts or settlements. One of these is
still standing at Northeast Point, on the large sand-dune there which
overlooks the killing-grounds, and another sound stalwart cross yet
faces the gales and driving “boorgas” on the summit of Bogaslov
Mountain, as it has withstood them during the last sixty years.</p>

<p>To the eastward, six miles from Northeast Point, will be noticed
a small rock named Walrus Island. It is a mere ledge of lava, flat-capped,
lifted just above the wash of angry waves; indeed, in
storms of great power, the observer, standing on either Cross or
Hutchinson’s Hills, with a field-glass, can see the water breaking
clear over it: these storms, however, occur late in the season,
usually in October or November. This island has little or no commercial
importance, being scarcely more than a quarter of a mile in
length and one hundred yards in point of greatest width, with bold
water all around, entirely free from reefs or sunken rocks. As
might be expected, there is no fresh water on it. In a fog it makes
an ugly neighbor for the sea-captains when they are searching for
St. Paul; they all know it, and they all dread it. It is not resorted
to by the fur-seals or by sea-lions in particular; but, singularly
enough, it is frequented by several hundred male walrus, to the
exclusion of females, every summer. A few sea-lions, but only a very
few, however, breed here. On account of the rough weather, fogs,
etc., this little islet is seldom visited by the natives of St. Paul, and
then only in the egging season of late June and early July when
that surf-beaten breakwater literally swarms with breeding sea-fowl.</p>

<p>This low, tiny, island is, perhaps, the most interesting single
spot now known to the naturalist who may land in northern seas,
to study the habits of bird-life; for here, without exertion or
risk, he can observe and walk among tens upon tens of thousands
of screaming water-fowl; and, as he sits down upon the polished
lava rock, he becomes literally ignored and environed by these
feathered friends, as they reassume their varied positions of incubation,
from which he disturbs them by his arrival. Generation
after generation of their kind have resorted to this rock unmolested,
and to-day, when you get among them, all doubt and distrust seem
to have been eliminated from their natures. The island itself is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
rather unusual in those formations which we find peculiar to Alaskan
waters. It is almost flat, with slight, irregular undulations on
top, spreading over an area of five acres perhaps. It rises abruptly,
though low, from the sea, and it has no safe beach upon which a
person can land from a boat; not a stick of timber or twig of
shrubbery ever grew upon it, though the scant presence of low,
crawling grasses in the central portions prevents the statement that
<em>all</em> vegetation is absent. Were it not for the frequent rains and
dissolving fog characteristic of summer weather here, the accumulation
of guano would be something wonderful to contemplate—Peru
would have a rival. As it is, however, the birds, when they return,
year after year, find their nesting-floor swept as clean as though
they had never sojourned there before. The scene of confusion
and uproar that presented itself to my astonished senses when I
approached this place in search of eggs, one threatening, foggy
July morning, may be better imagined than described, for, as the
clumsy bidarrah came under the lee of the low cliffs, swarm upon
swarm of thousands of murres or “arries” dropped in fright from
their nesting-shelves, and, before they had control of their flight,
they struck to the right and left of me, like so many cannon-balls. I
was forced, in self-protection, to instantly crouch for a few moments
under the gunwale of the boat until the struggling, startled flock
passed, like an irresistible, surging wave, over my head. Words
cannot depict the amazement and curiosity with which I gazed
around after climbing up to the rocky plateau, and stood among
myriads of breeding-birds; they fairly covered the entire surface of
the island with their shrinking forms, while others whirled in rapid
flight over my head, as wheels within wheels, so thickly inter-running
that the blue and gray of the sky was hidden from my view.
Add to this impression the stunning whir of hundreds of thousands
of strong, beating wings, the shrill screams of the gulls, and a
muffled croaking of the “arries,” coupled with an indescribable,
disagreeable smell which arose from broken eggs and other decaying
substances—then a faint idea may be evoked of the strange
reality spread before me. Were it not for this island and the ease
with which the natives can gather, in a few hours, tons upon tons
of sea-fowl eggs, the people of St. Paul would be obliged to go
the westward, and suspend themselves from the lofty cliffs of Einahnuhto,
dangling over the sea by ropes, as their less favored neighbors
are only too glad and willing to do at St. George.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>I am much divided in my admiration of the two great bird-rookeries
of this Pribylov group, the one on the face of the high bluffs
at St. George, and the other on the table-top of Walrus Islet; but
perhaps the latter place gives, within the smallest area, the greatest
variety of nesting and breeding birds, for here the “arrie” and
many gulls, cormorants, sea-parrots, and auks come to lay their
eggs in countless numbers. The face and brow of the low, cliff-like
sea-front to this island are occupied almost exclusively by the
“arries,” <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lomvia arra</i>, which lay a single egg each on the surface
of the bare rock, and stand, just like so many champagne bottles,
straddling over them while hatching, only leaving at irregular intervals
to feed, and then not until their mates relieve them. Hundreds
of thousands of these birds alone are thus engaged about
the 29th of every June on this little rocky island, roosting stacked
up together as tight as so many sardines in a box, as compactly as
they can be stowed, each and all of them uttering an incessant,
muffled, hoarse, grunting noise. How fiercely they quarrel among
themselves—everlastingly! and in this way thousands of eggs are
rolled off into the sea, or into crevices, or into fissures, where they
are lost and broken.</p>

<p>The “arrie” lays but one egg. If it is removed or broken, she
will soon lay another; but if undisturbed after depositing the first,
she undertakes its hatching at once. The size, shape, and coloration
of this egg, among the thousands which came under my observation,
are exceedingly variable. A large proportion of the eggs
become so dirty by rolling here and there in the guano while the
birds tread and fight over them as to be almost unrecognizable. I
was struck by a happy adaptation of nature to their rough nesting.
It is found in the toughness of this shell of the egg, so tough
that the natives, when gathering them, throw them as farmers do
apples into their tubs, baskets, etc., on the cliff, and then carry
them down to a general heap of collection near the boats’ landing,
where they are poured out upon the rocks with a single flip of
the hand, just as a sack of potatoes would be emptied; and then
again, after this, they are quite as carelessly handled when loaded
into the “bidarrah,” sustaining through it all a very trifling loss
from crushed or broken specimens.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>These “arries” seem to occupy a ribbon strip in width: it is
drawn around the outward edges of the flat table-top to Walrus
Island as a regular belt, reserved all to themselves: while the small
grassy interior from which they are thus self-excluded is the only
place, I believe, in Bering Sea where the big white gull, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Larus
glaucus</i>, breeds. Here I found among grassy tussocks the white
burgomaster building a nest of dry grass, sea-ferns, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sertularidæ</i>,
etc., very nicely laid up and rounded, and in which it laid usually
three eggs, sometimes only a couple; occasionally I would look into
a nest with four. These heavy gulls could not breed on either of
the other islands in this manner, for the glaucous gull is too large
to settle on the narrow shelf-ledges of the cliffs, as the smaller gulls
do, and lesser water-fowls, and those places which could receive it
would also be a happy hunting-ground and footing to the foxes.</p>

<p>The red-legged kittiwake, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rissa brevirostris</i>, and its cousin,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rissa tridactyla</i>, build in the most amicable manner together on
the faces of those cliffs, for they are little gulls, and they associate
with cormorants, sea-parrots, and tiny auks, all together, and, with
the exception of the last, their nests are very easy of access. All
birds, especially the “arries,” have an exceedingly happy time of it
on this Walrus Islet—nothing to disturb them, in my opinion, free
from the ravenous maw of blue foxes over on St. Paul, and from the
piratical and death-dealing sweep of owls and hawks, which infest
the Aleutian chain and the mainland.</p>

<p>The position of the islands is such as to be somewhat outside
of that migratory path pursued by the birds on the mainland, and
owing to this reason they are only visited by a few stragglers from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
that quarter, a few from the Asiatic side, and by the millions of
their own home-bred and indigenous stock. One of these migratory
species, a turnstone, however, comes here every summer, for
three or four weeks’ stay, in great numbers, and actually gets so
fat in feeding upon the larvæ which abound in the decaying carcasses
over the killing-grounds that it usually bursts open when it
falls, shot on the wing. A heavy easterly gale once brought a
strange bird to the islands from the mainland—a grebe, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. griseigena</i>.
It was stranded on St. George in 1873, whereupon the natives
declared the like of which they had never seen before; again, I
found a robin one cool morning in October, the 15th: the natives
told me that it was an accident—brought over by some storm or
gale of wind that took it up and off from its path across the tundra
of Bristol Bay. The next fair wind sweeping from the north or
the west could be so improved by this robin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. migratoria</i>, that
it would spread its wings and as abruptly return. Thus hawks,
owls, and a number of strange water-fowls visit the islands, but
never remain there long.</p>

<p>The Russians tried the experiment of bringing up from Sitka
and Oonalashka a flock of ravens, as scavengers, a number of years
ago, and when they were very uncleanly in the village, in contrast
with the practice of the present hour. They reasoned that
they would—these ill-omened birds—be invaluable as health officers;
but the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corvidæ</i> invariably, sooner or later, and within a very
short time, took the first wind-train or lightning-express back to
the mainland or the Aleutian islands. Yet the natives say that if
the birds had been young ones instead of old fellows they would
have remained. I saw a great many, however, at St. Matthew
Island in August, 1874.</p>

<p>A glance at the map of St. Paul shows that nearly half of its
superficial area is low and quite flat, not much elevated above the
sea. Wherever the sand-dune tracts are located, and that is right
along the coast, will be found an irregular succession of hummocks
and hillocks, drifted by the wind, which are very characteristic. On
the summits of these hillocks an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elymus</i> has taken root in times
past, and, as the sand drifts up, it keeps growing on and up too,
so that a quaint spectacle is presented of large stretches to the view
wherein sand-dunes, entirely bare of all vegetation at their base
and on their sides, are crowned with a living cap of the brightest
green—a tuft of long, waving grass blades which will not down.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
None of this peculiar landscaping, however, is seen on St. George,
not even in the faintest degree. Travel about St. Paul, with the
exception of that trail to Northeast Point, where the natives take
advantage of low water to run on the hard, wet sand, is exceedingly
difficult, and there are examples of only a few white men who have
ever taken the trouble and expended the physical energy necessary
to accomplish a comparatively short walk from the village to
Nahsayvernia, or the north shore. Walking upon the moss-hidden
and slippery rocks, or tumbling over slightly uncertain tussocks, is
a task and not a pleasure. On St. George, with the exception of a
half-mile path to the village cemetery and back, nobody pretends
to walk, except the natives who go to and from the rookeries in
their regular seal-drives. Indeed, I am told that I am the only
white man who has ever traversed the entire coast-line of both
islands.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>Turning to St. George and its profile, presented by the accompanying
map, the observer will be struck at once by the solidity of
that little island and its great boldness, rising, as it does, sheer and
precipitous from the sea all around, except at the three short
reaches of the coast indicated on my chart, and where the only
chance to come ashore exists.</p>

<p>The seals naturally have no such opportunity to gain a footing
here as they have on St. Paul, hence their comparative insignificance
as to number. The island itself is a trifle over ten miles in extreme
length, east and west, and about four and a quarter miles in
greatest width, north and south. It looks, when plotted, somewhat
like an old stone axe; and, indeed, when I had finished my initial contours
from my field-notes, the ancient stone-axe outline so disturbed
me that I felt obliged to resurvey the southern shore, in order that
I might satisfy my own mind as to the accuracy of my first work.
It consists of two great plateaus, with a high upland valley between,
the western table-land dropping abruptly to the sea at Dalnoi
Mees, while the eastern falls as precipitately at Waterfall Head
and Tolstoi Mees. There are several little reservoirs of fresh
water—I can scarcely call them lakes—on this island; pools, rather,
that the wet sphagnum seems to always keep full, and from which
drinking-water in abundance is everywhere found. At Garden
Cove is a small, living stream: it is the only one on the Pribylov
group.</p>

<p>St. George has an area of about twenty-seven square miles; it
has twenty-nine miles of coast-line, of which only two and a quarter
are visited by the fur-seals, and which is in fact all the eligible
landing-ground afforded them by the structure of the island.
Nearly half of the shore of St. Paul is a sandy beach, while on St.
George there is less than a mile of it all put together, namely: a
few hundred yards in front of the village, the same extent on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>Garden Cove beach, southeast side, and less than half a mile at
Zapadnie on the south side.</p>

<p>Just above the Garden Cove, under the overhanging bluffs,
several thousand sea-lions hold exclusive, though shy, possession.
Here there is a half-mile of good landing. On the north shore of
the island, three miles west from the village, a grand bluff wall of
basalt and tufa intercalated rises abruptly from the sea to a sheer
height of nine hundred and twenty feet at its reach of greatest
elevation: thence, dropping a little, runs clear around the island to
Zapadnie, a distance of nearly ten miles, without affording a single
passage-way up or down to the sea that thunders at its base. Upon
its innumerable narrow shelf-margins, and in its countless chinks
and crannies, and back therefrom over an extended area of lava-shingled
inland ridges and terraces, millions upon millions of water-fowl
breed during the summer months.</p>

<p>The general altitude of St. George, though in itself not great,
has, however, an average three times higher than that of St. Paul,
the elevation of which is quite low, and slopes gently down to the
sea east and north; St. George rises abruptly, with exceptional
spots for landing. The loftiest summit on St. George, the top of
the hill right back to the southward of the village, is nine hundred
and thirty feet, and is called by the natives Ahluckeyak. That on
St. Paul, as I have before said, is Bogaslov Hill, six hundred feet.
All elevations on either island, fifteen or twenty feet above sea-level,
are rough and hummocky, with the exception of those sand-dune
tracts at St. Paul and the summits of the cinder hills, on both
islands. Weathered out, or washed from the basalt and pockets of
olivine on either island, are aggregates of augite, seen most abundant
on the summit slopes of Ahluckeyak Hill, St. George. Specimens
from stratified bands of old, friable, gray lavas, so conspicuous
on the shore of this latter island, show an existence of hornblende
and vitreous felspar in considerable quantity, while on
the south shore, near Garden Cove, is a large dike of a bluish
and greenish gray phonolite, in which numerous small crystals of
spinel are found. A dike, with well-defined walls, of old close-grained,
clay-colored lava, is near the village of St. George, about
a quarter of a mile east from the landing, in the face of those reddish
breccia bluffs that rise from the sea. It is the only example
of the kind on the islands. The bases or foundations of the Pribylov
Islands are, all of them, basaltic; some are compact and grayish-white,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
but most of them exceedingly porous and ferruginous.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
Upon this solid floor are many hills of brown and red tufa, cinder-heaps,
etc. Polavina Sopka, the second point in elevation on St.
Paul Island, is almost entirely built up of red scoria and breccia;
so is Ahluckeyak Hill, on St. George, and the cap to the high bluffs
opposite. The village hill at St. Paul, Cone hill, the Einahnuhto
peaks, Crater Hill, North Hill, and Little Polavina are all ash-heaps
of this character. The bluffs at the shore of Polavina Point, St.
Paul, show in a striking manner a section of the geological structure
of the island. The tufas on both islands, at the surface, decompose
and weather into the base of good soil, which the severe
climate, however, renders useless to good husbandmen. There is
not a trace of granitic or of gneissoid rocks found <em>in situ</em>. Metamorphic
boulders have been collected along the beaches and
pushed up by heavy ice-floes which have brought them down from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
Siberian coasts far away to the northwest. The dark-brown tufa
bluffs and the breccia walls at the east landing of St. Paul Island,
known as “Black Bluffs,” rise suddenly from the sea sixty to eighty
feet, with stratified horizontal lines of light-gray calcareous conglomerate,
or cement, in which are embedded sundry fossils characteristic
of and belonging to the Tertiary Age, such as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cardium
grœnlandicum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. decoratum</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Astarte pectunculata</i>, etc. This is
the only locality within the purview of the Pribylov Islands where
any palæontological evidence of their age can be found. These
specimens, as indicated, are exceedingly abundant; I brought
down a whole series, gathered there at the east landing or “Navastock,”
in a short half-hour’s search and labor.</p>

<p>Although small quantities of drift-wood lodge at all points of
the coast, yet the greatest amount is found on the south shore, and
thence around to Garden Cove; this drift-timber is usually wholly
stripped of its bark, principally pine and fir sticks, some of them
quite large, eighteen inches or two feet in diameter. Several years
occur when a large driftage will be thrown or stranded here; then
long intervals of many seasons will elapse with scarcely a log or
stick coming ashore. I found at Garden Cove, in June, 1873, the
well-preserved husk of a cocoanut, cast up by the surf on the beach:
did I not know that it was most undoubtedly thrown over by some
whaler in these waters, not many hundred miles away at the farthest,
I should have indulged in a pretty reverie as to its path in
drifting from the South Seas to this lonely islet. I presume, however,
that the timber which the sea brings for the Pribylov Islands
is that borne down upon the annual floods of the Kuskokvim and
Nooshagak Rivers on the mainland, and to the east-northeastward, a
trifle more than two hundred and twenty-five miles; it comes, however,
in very scant supply. I saw very little drift-wood on St. Matthew
Island; but on the eastern shore of St. Lawrence there was
an immense aggregate, which unquestionably came from the Yukon
mouth.</p>

<p>The fact that fur-seals frequent these islands and those of
Bering and Copper, on the Russian side, to the exclusion of other
land, seems at first odd or singular, to say the least; but when we
come to examine the subject we find that those animals, when they
repair hither to rest for two or three months on the land, as they
must do by their habit during the breeding-season, require a cool,
moist atmosphere, imperatively coupled with firm, well-drained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
land, or dry broken rocks or shingle, rather, upon which to take
their positions and remain undisturbed by the weather and the sea
for a lengthy period of reproduction. If the rookery-ground is
hard and flat, with an admixture of loam or soil, puddles are speedily
formed in this climate, where it rains almost every day, and when
not raining, rain-fogs take rapid succession and continue the saturation,
making thus a muddy slime, which very quickly takes the
hair off the animals whenever it plasters or wherever it fastens on
them; hence they carefully avoid any such landing. If they occupy
a sandy shore the rain beats that material into their large,
sensitive eyes, and into their fur, so they are obliged, from simple
irritation, to leave and return to the sea for relief.</p>

<p>This inspection of some natural characteristics of the Pribylov
group renders it quite plain that the Seal Islands, now under discussion,
offer to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinnipedia</i> very remarkable advantages for landing,
especially so at St. Paul, where the ground of basaltic rock and of
volcanic tufa or cement slopes up from many points gradually above
the sea, making thereby a perfectly adapted resting-place for any
number, from a thousand to millions, of those intelligent animals,
which can lie out here from May until October every year in perfect
physical peace and security. There is not a rod of ground of
this character offered to these animals elsewhere in all Alaska, not
on the Aleutian chain, not on the mainland, not on St. Matthew or
St. Lawrence. Both of the latter islands were surveyed by myself,
with special reference to this query, in 1874; every foot of St. Matthew
shore-line was examined, and I know that the fur-seal could
not rest on the low clayey flats there in contentment a single
day; hence he never has rested there, nor will he in the future.
As to St. Lawrence, it is so ice-bound and snow-covered in spring
and early summer, to say nothing of numerous other physical disadvantages,
that it never becomes of the slightest interest to fur-seals.</p>

<p>When Pribylov, in taking possession, landed on St. George a
part of his little ship’s crew, July, 1786, he knew that, as it was uninhabited,
it would be necessary to establish a colony there from
which to draft laborers to do all killing, skinning, and curing of
the peltries; therefore he and his associates, and his rivals after
him, imported natives of Oonalashka and Atkha—passive, docile
Aleutes. They founded their first village a quarter of a mile to the
eastward of one of the principal rookeries on St. George, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
called “Starry Arteel,” or “Old Settlement”; a village was also located
at Zapadnie, and a succession of barraboras planted at Garden
Cove. Then, during the following season, more men were brought
up from Atkha and taken over to St. Paul, where five or six rival
traders posted themselves on the north shore, near and at “Maroonitch,”
and at the head of the Big Lake, among the sand-dunes
there. They were then, as they are now, somewhat given to riotous
living if they only had the chance, and the ruins of the Big Lake
settlement are pleasantly remembered by the descendants of those
pioneers to-day, on St. Paul, who take off their hats as they pass
by to affectionately salute, and call the place “Vesolia Mista,” or
“Jolly Spot”—the aged men telling me, in a low whisper, that “in
those good old days they had plenty of rum.” But, when the pressure
of competition became great, another village was located at
Polavina, and still another at Zapadnie, until the activity and unscrupulous
energy of all these rival settlements well-nigh drove out
and eliminated the seals in 1796. Three years later the whole territory
of Alaska passed into the hands of the absolute power vested
in the Russian American Company. These islands were in the bill
of sale, and early in 1799 the competing traders were turned off
neck and heels from them, and the Pribylov group passed under
the control of a single man, the iron-willed Baranov. The people
on St. Paul were then all drawn together, for economy and warmth,
into a single settlement at Polavina. Their life in those days must
have been miserable. They were mere slaves, without the slightest
redress from any insolence or injury which their masters might see
fit, in petulance or brutal orgies, to inflict upon them. Here they
lived and died, unnoticed and uncared for, in large barracoons half
under ground and dirt-roofed, cold and filthy. Along toward the
beginning or end of 1825, in order that they might reap the advantage
of being located best to load and unload ships, the Polavina
settlement was removed to the present village site, as indicated on
the map, and the natives have lived there ever since.</p>

<p>On St. George the several scattered villages were abandoned,
and consolidated at the existing location some years later, but for
a different reason. The labor of bringing the seal-skins over to
Garden Cove, which is the best and surest landing, was so great,
and that of carrying them from the north shore to Zapadnie still
greater, that it was decided to place the consolidated settlement at
such a point between them, on the north shore, that the least trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
and exertion of conveyance would be necessary. A better place,
geographically, for the business of gathering the skins and salting
them down at St. George cannot be found on the island, but a
poorer place for a landing it is difficult to pick out, though in this
respect there is not much choice outside of Garden Cove.</p>

<p>Up to the time of the transfer of the territory and leasing of
the islands to the Alaska Commercial Company, in August, 1870,
these native inhabitants all lived in huts or sod-walled and dirt-roofed
houses, called “barrabkies,” partly under ground. Most of
these huts were damp, dark, and exceedingly filthy: it seemed to be
the policy of a short-sighted Russian management to keep them
so, and to treat the natives not near so well as they treated the few
hogs and dogs which they brought up there for food and for company.
The use of seal-fat for fuel, caused the deposit upon everything
within doors of a thick coat of greasy, black soot, strongly impregnated
with a damp, moldy, and indescribably offensive odor.
They found along the north shore of St. Paul and at Northeast
Point, occasionally scattered pieces of drift-wood, which was used,
carefully soaked anew in water if it had dried out, split into little
fragments, and, trussing the blubber with it when making their fires,
the combination gave rise to a roaring, spluttering blaze. If this
drift-wood failed them at any time when winter came round, they
were obliged to huddle together beneath skins in their cold huts,
and live or die, as the case might be. But the situation to-day has
changed marvellously. We see here now at St. Paul, and on St.
George, in the place of the squalid, filthy habitations of the immediate
past, two villages, neat, warm, and contented. Each family
lives in a snug frame-dwelling; every house is lined with tarred
paper, painted, furnished with a stove, with out-houses, etc., complete;
streets laid out, and the foundations of these habitations regularly
plotted thereon. There is a large church at St. Paul, and a
less pretentious but very creditable structure of the same character
on St. George; a hospital on St. Paul, with a full and complete
stock of drugs, and skilled physicians on both islands to take care
of the people, free of cost. There is a school-house on each island,
in which teachers are also paid by the company eight months in the
year, to instruct the youth, while the Russian Church is sustained
entirely by the pious contributions of the natives themselves on
these two islands, and sustained well by each other. There are
eighty families, or eighty houses, on St. Paul, in the village, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
twenty or twenty-four such houses to as many families at St. George,
and eight other structures. The large warehouses and salt-sheds
of the Alaska Commercial Company, built by skilful mechanics, as
have been the dwellings just referred to, are also neatly painted;
and, taken in combination with the other features, constitute a picture
fully equal to the average presentation of any one of our small
eastern towns There is no misery, no downcast, dejected, suffering
humanity here to-day. These Aleutes, who enjoy as a price of
their good behavior, the sole right to take and skin seals for the
company, to the exclusion of all other people, are known to and by
their less fortunate neighbors elsewhere in Alaska as the “Bogatskie
Aloutov,” or the “rich Aleutes.” The example of the agents of
the Alaska Commercial Company, on both islands, from the beginning
of its lease, and the course of the Treasury agents during the
last eight or nine years, have been silent but powerful promoters of
the welfare of these people. They have maintained perfect order;
they have directed neatness, and cleanliness, and stimulated industry,
such as those natives had never before dreamed of.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The chief
source of sickness used to arise from the wretched character of the
barrabkies in which they lived; but it was, at first, a very difficult
matter to get frame-houses to supplant successfully the sod-walled
and dirt-roofed huts of the islands.</p>

<p>Many experiments, however, were made, and a dozen houses
built, ere the result was as good as the style of primitive housing,
when it had been well done and kept in best possible repair. In
such a damp climate, naturally, a strong moldy smell pervades all
inclosed rooms which are not thoroughly heated and daily dried by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
fires; and, in the spring and fall, frost works through and drips
and trickles like rain adown the walls. The present frame-houses
occupied by the natives owe their dryness, their warmth, and protection
from the piercing “boorgas” to the liberal use of stout
tarred paper in the lining. An overpowering mustiness of the hallways,
out-houses, and, in fact, every roofed-in spot, where a stove is
not regularly used, even in the best-built residences, is one of the
first disagreeable sensations which the new arrivals always experience
when they take up their quarters here. Perhaps, if it were
not for the nasal misery that floats in from the killing-grounds to
the novice, this musty, moldy state of things up here would be far
more acute, as an annoyance, than it is now. The greater grief
seems to soon fully absorb the lesser one; at least, in my own case,
I can affirm the result.</p>

<p>As they lived in early time, it was a physical impossibility for
them to increase and multiply;<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> but, since their elevation and their
sanitary advancement are so marked, it may be reasonably expected
that those people for all time to come will at least hold their own,
even though they do not increase to any remarkable degree. Perhaps
it is better that they should not. But it is exceedingly fortunate
that they do sustain themselves so as to be, as it were, a
prosperous corporate factor, entitled to the exclusive privilege of
labor on these islands. As an encouragement for their good behavior
the Alaska Commercial Company, in pursuance of its enlightened
treatment of the whole subject, so handsomely exhibited by
its housing of these people, has assured them that so long as they
are capable and willing to perform the labor of skinning the seal-catch
every year, so long will they enjoy the sole privilege of participating
in that toil and its reward. This is wise on the part of
the company, and it is exceedingly happy for the people. They
are, of all men, especially fitted for the work connected with the
seal-business—no comment is needed—nothing better in the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
of manual labor, skilled and rapid, could be rendered by any body
of men, equal in numbers, living under the same circumstances, all
the year round. They appear to shake off the periodic lethargy of
winter and its forced inanition, to rush with the coming of summer
into the severe exercise and duty of capturing, killing, and skinning
the seals, with vigor and with persistent and commendable energy.</p>

<p>To-day only a very small proportion of the population are descendants
of the pioneers who were brought here by the several
Russian companies in 1787 and 1788; a colony of one hundred and
thirty-seven souls, it is claimed, principally recruited at Oonalashka
and Atkha.</p>

<p>The Aleutes on the islands as they appear to-day have been so
mixed in with Russian, Koloshian, and Kamschadale blood that
they present characteristics, in one way or another, of all the various
races of men from the negro up to the Caucasian. The predominant
features among them are small, wide-set eyes, broad and
high cheek-bones, causing the jaw, which is full and square, to
often appear peaked; coarse, straight, black hair, small, neatly-shaped
feet and hands, together with brownish-yellow complexion.
The men will average in stature five feet four or five inches; the
women less in proportion, although there are exceptions to this
rule among them, some being over six feet in height, and others
are decided dwarfs. The manners and customs of these people to-day
possess nothing in themselves of a barbarous or remarkable
character aside from that which belongs to an advanced state of
semi-civilization. They are exceedingly polite and civil, not only
in their business with the agents of the company on the seal-islands,
but among themselves, and they visit, the one with the
other, freely and pleasantly, the women being great gossips; but,
on the whole, their intercourse is subdued, for the simple reason
that the topics of conversation are few: and, judging from their
silent but unconstrained meetings, they seem to have a mutual
knowledge, as if by sympathy, as to what may be occupying each
other’s minds, rendering speech superfluous. It is only when under
the influence of beer or strong liquor that they lose their naturally
quiet and amiable disposition. They then relapse into low,
drunken orgies and loud, brawling noises.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Having been so long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
under the control and influence of the Russians, they have adopted
many Slavic customs, such as giving birthday-dinners, naming
their children, etc. They are remarkably attached to their church,
and no other form of religion could be better adapted or have a
firmer hold upon the sensibilities of the people. Their inherent
chastity and sobriety cannot be commended. They have long since
thrown away the uncouth garments of Russian rule—those shaggy
dog-skin caps, with coats half seal and half sea-lion—for a complete
outfit, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cap-à-pie</i>, such as our own people buy in any furnishing
house, the same boots, socks, underclothing, and clothing, with
ulsters and ulsterettes; but the violence of the wind prevents their
selecting the hats of our fashion and sporting fraternity. As for
the women, they, too, have kept pace and even advanced to the
level of the men, for in these lower races there is usually more vanity
displayed by the masculine element than the feminine, according
to my observation. In other words, I have noticed a greater desire
among the young men than among the young women of savage and
semi-civilized people to be gaily dressed, and to look fine; but the
visits of the wives of our treasury officials and the company’s agents
to these islands during the last ten years, bringing with them a full
outfit, as ladies always do, of everything under the sun that women
want to wear, has given the native female mind an undue expansion
up there and stimulated it to unwonted activity. They watch the
cut of the garments and borrow the patterns, and some of them are
very expert dressmakers to-day. When the Russians controlled
affairs, the women were the hewers of drift-wood and the drawers
of water. At St. Paul there was no well of drinking-fluid
about the village, nor within half a mile of the village. There was
no drinking-water unless it was caught in reservoirs, and the cistern-water,
owing to those particles of seal-fat soot which fall upon
the roofs of the houses, is rendered undrinkable, so that the supply
for the town until quite recently used to be carried by women from
two little lakes at the head of the lagoon, a mile and a half as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
crow flies from the village, and right under Telegraph Hill. This is
quite a journey, and when it is remembered that they drink so much
tea, and that water has to go with it, some idea of the labor of the
old and young females can be derived from an inspection of the
map. Latterly, within the last four or five years, the company have
opened a spring less than half a mile from the “gorode,” which
they have plumbed and regulated, so that it supplies them with
water now and renders the labor next to nothing, compared with
all former difficulty. But to-day, when water is wanted in the
Aleutian houses at St. Paul, the man has to get it—the woman does
not; he trudges out with a little wooden firkin or tub on his back
and brings it to the house.</p>

<p>Some of the natives save their money; yet there are very few
among them, perhaps not more than a dozen, who have the slightest
economical tendency. What they cannot spend for luxuries,
groceries, and tobacco they manage to get away with at the gaming-table.
They have their misers and their spendthrifts, and they
have the usual small proportion who know how to make money,
and then how to spend it. A few among them who are in the habit
of saving have opened a regular bank-account with the company.
Some of them have to-day two or three thousand dollars saved,
drawing an interest of nine per cent.</p>

<p>When the ships arrive and go, the severe and necessary labor of
lightering their cargoes off and on from the roadsteads where they
anchor is principally performed by these people, and they are paid
so much a day for their labor: from fifty cents to one dollar, according
to the character of the service they render. This operation,
however, is much dreaded by the ship-captains and sea-going men,
whose habits of discipline and automatic regularity and effect of
working render them severe critics and impatient coadjutors of the
natives, who, to tell the truth, hate to do anything after they have
pocketed their reward for sealing; and when they do labor after
this, they regard it as an act of very great condescension on their
part.</p>

<p>As they are living to-day up there, there is no restraint, such as
the presence of policemen, courts of justice, fines, etc., which we
employ for the suppression of disorder and maintenance of the law
in our own land. They understand that if it is necessary to make
them law-abiding, and to punish crime, such officers will be among
them, and hence, perhaps, is due the fact that from the time that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
the Alaska Commercial Company has taken charge, in 1870, there
has not been one single occasion where the simplest functions of a
justice of the peace would or could have been called in to settle any
difficulty. This speaks eloquently for their docile nature and their
amiable disposition.</p>

<p>These people are singularly affectionate and indulgent toward
their children. There are no “bald-headed” tyrants in our homes
as arbitrary and ruthless in their rule as are those snuffly babies
and young children on the Seal Islands. While it is very young,
the Aleut gives up everything to the caprice of his child, and never
crosses its path or thwarts its desire; the “deetiah” literally take
charge of the house; but as soon as these callow members of the
family become strong enough to bear burdens and to labor,
generally between twelve and fifteen years of age, they are then
pressed into hard service relentlessly by their hitherto indulgent
parents. The extremes literally meet in this application.</p>

<p>They have another peculiarity: when they are ill, slightly or
seriously, no matter which, they maintain or affect a stolid resignation,
and are patient to positive apathy. This is not due to deficiency
of nervous organization, because those among them who
exhibit examples of intense liveliness and nervous activity behave
just as stolidly when ill as their more lymphatic townsmen do.
Boys and girls, men and women, all alike, are patient and resigned
when ailing and under treatment; but it is a bad feature after all,
inasmuch as it is well-nigh impossible to rally a very sick man who
himself has no hope, and who seems to mutely deprecate every
effort to save his life. The principal cause of death among the
people, by natural infirmity, on the Seal Islands is the varying
forms of consumption and bronchitis, always greatly aggravated by
that inherited scrofulous taint or stain of blood which was, in one
way or another, flowing through the veins of their recent progenitors,
both here and throughout the Aleutian Islands. There is
nothing worth noticing in the line of nervous diseases, unless it be
now and then the record of a case of alcoholism superinduced by
excessive quass drinking. The “makoolah” intemperance among
these people, which was not suppressed until 1876, was a chief
factor to an immediate death of infants; for, when they were at
the breast, their mothers would drink quass to intoxication, and the
stomachs of newly-born Aleutes or Creoles could not stand the
infliction which they received, even second-hand. Had it not been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
for this wretched spectacle, so often presented to my eyes in 1872-73,
I should hardly have taken the active steps which I did to put
the nuisance down; for it involved me, at first, in a bitter personal
controversy, which, although I knew at the outset was inevitable,
still it weighed nothing in the scales against the evil itself. A few
febrile disorders are occurring, yet they yield readily to good
treatment.</p>

<p>The inherent propensity of man to gamble is developed here to
a very appreciable degree, but it in no way whatever suggests the
strange gaming love and infatuation with which all Indians and
Eskimo elsewhere of Alaska are possessed. The chief delight of
men and boys in the two villages is to stand on the street corners
“pitching” half-dollars. So devoted, indeed, have I found
the native mind to this hap-hazard sport, that frequently I would
detect groups of them standing out in pelting gales of wind and of
rain, “shying” silver coins at the little dirt-driven pegs. A few
of them, men and women, play cards with much skill and intelligence.</p>

<p>One of the peculiarities<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> of these people is that they seldom
undress when they go to bed—neither the men, women, nor children;
and also that at any and all hours of the night during the
summer season, when I have passed in and out of the village to and
from the rookeries, I always found several of the natives squatting
before their house-doors or leaning against the walls, stupidly staring
out into the misty darkness of the fog, or chatting one with the
other over their pipes. A number of the inhabitants, by this disposition,
are always up and around throughout the settlement
during the entire night and day. In olden times, and even recently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
these involuntary sentinels of the night have often startled the
whole village by shouting at the top of their voices the pleasant
and electric announcement of the “ship’s light!” or they have
frozen it with superstitious horror at daybreak by then reciting
some ghostly vision that had appeared to them.</p>

<p>The urchins play marbles, spin tops, and fly kites, intermittently,
with all the feverish energy displayed by such youth of our own surroundings;
they frolic at base-ball, and use “shinny” sticks with
great volubility and activity. The girls are, however, much more
repressed, and, though they have a few games, and play quietly
with quaintly dressed dolls, yet they do not appear to be possessed
of that usual feminine animation so conspicuously marked in our
home-life.</p>

<p>The attachment which the natives have for their respective islands
was well shown to me in 1874. Then a number of St. George people
were taken over to St. Paul, temporarily, to do the killing incidental
to a reduction of the quota of twenty-five thousand for their
island and a corresponding increase at St. Paul. They became
homesick immediately, and were never tired of informing the St.
Paul natives that St. George was a far handsomer and more enjoyable
island to live upon; that walking over the long sand reaches
of “Pavel” made their legs grievously weary, and that the whole
effect of this change of residence was “ochen scootchnie.” Naturally
the ire of the St. Paul people rose at once, and they retorted
in kind, indicating the rocky surface of St. George and its great inferiority
as a seal-island. I was surprised at the genuine feeling on
both sides, because, as far as I could judge from a residence on
each island, it was a clear case of tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum between
them as to opportunities and climate necessary for a pleasurable
existence. The natives themselves are of one and common
stock, though the number of Creoles on St. George is relatively
much larger than on St. Paul. Consequently the tone of the St.
George village is rather more sprightly and vivacious.</p>

<p>The question is naturally asked, How do these people employ
themselves during the long nine months of every year after the
close of the sealing season and until it begins again, when they
have little or absolutely nothing to do? It may be answered that
they simply vegetate, or, in other words, are entirely idle, mentally
and physically, during most of this period. But, to their credit,
let it be said that mischief does not employ their idle hands. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
are passive killers of time, drinking tea and sleeping, with a few
disagreeable exceptions, such as the gamblers. There are a half-dozen
of these characters at St. Paul, and perhaps as many at St.
George, who spend whole nights at their sittings, even during the
sealing season, playing games of cards taught by Russians and persons
who have been on the island since the transfer of the territory;
but the majority of the men, women, and children, not being compelled
to exert themselves to obtain any of the chief or even the
least of the necessaries of life, such as tea and hard bread, sleep
the greater portion of the time, when not busy in eating and in the
daily observances of that routine belonging to the Greek Catholic
Church. The teachings, pomp, and circumstance of the religious observances
of this faith alone preserve these people from absolute stagnation.
In obedience to its promptings they gladly attend church
very regularly. They also make and receive calls on their saints’
days, and such days are very numerous. The natives add to these
entertainments of their saints’ day and birth-festivals, or “Emannimiks,”
the music of accordions and violins. Upon the former
and its variation, the concertina, they play a number of airs, and
are real fond of the noise. A great many of the women in particular
can render indifferently a limited selection of tunes, many of
which are the old battle-songs, so popular during the rebellion,
woven into weird Russian waltzes and love-ditties, which they have
jointly gathered from their former masters and our soldiers, who
were quartered here in 1869. From the Russians and the troops
also they have learned to dance various figures, and have been
taught to waltz. These dances, however, the old folks do not enjoy
very much. They will come in and sit around and look at the
young performers with stolid indifference; but if they manage to
get a strong current of tea setting in their direction, nicely sugared
and toned up, they revive and join in the mirth. In old times they
never danced here unless they were drunk, and it was the principal
occupation of the amiable and mischievous treasury agents and
others in those early days to stimulate this beery fun.</p>

<p>Seal-meat is their staple food, and in the village of St. Paul
they consume on an average fully five hundred pounds a day the
year round, and they are, by the permission of the Secretary of the
Treasury, allowed occasionally to kill five thousand or six thousand
seal-pups, or an average of twenty-two to thirty young “kotickie”
for each man, woman, and child in the settlements. The pups will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
dress ten pounds each. This shows an average consumption of
nearly six hundred pounds of seal-meat by each person, large and
small, during the year. To this diet the natives add a great deal
of butter and many sweet crackers. They are passionately fond of
butter. No epicure at home or butter-taster in Goshen knows or
appreciates that article better than these people do. If they could
get all that they desire, they would consume one thousand pounds
of butter and five hundred pounds of sweet crackers every week,
and indefinite quantities of sugar. The sweetest of all sweet teeth
are found in the jaw of the ordinary Aleut. But it is of course unwise
to allow them full swing in this matter, for they would turn
their stomachs into fermenting-tanks if they had free access to an
unlimited supply of saccharine food. The company issues them
two hundred pounds a week. If unable to get sweet crackers,
they will eat about three hundred pounds of hard or pilot bread
every week, and, in addition to this, nearly seven hundred pounds
of flour at the same time. Of tobacco they are allowed fifty pounds
per week; candles, seventy-five pounds; rice, fifty pounds. They
burn, strange as it may seem, kerosene-oil here to the exclusion of
that seal-fat which literally overruns the island. They ignite and
consume over six hundred gallons of kerosene-oil a year in the village
of St. Paul alone. They do not fancy vinegar very much; perhaps
fifty gallons a year are used up there. Mustard and pepper are
sparingly used, one to one pound and a half a week for the whole
village. Beans they peremptorily reject; for some reason or other
they cannot be induced to use them. Those who go about the vessels
contract a taste for split-pea soup, and a few of them are sold
in the village-store. Salt meat, beef or pork, they will take reluctantly,
if it is given to and pressed upon them; but they will never
buy it. I remember, in this connection, seeing two barrels of prime
salt pork and a barrel of prime mess salt beef opened in the company’s
store shortly after my arrival in 1872, and, though the people
of the village were invited to help themselves, I think I am right
in saying these three barrels were not emptied when I left the island
in 1873. They use a very little coffee during the year—not more
than one hundred pounds—but of tea a great deal. I do not know
exactly—I cannot find among my notes a record as to that article—but
I can say that they each drink not less than a gallon of tea
per diem. The amount of this beverage which they sip from the
time they rise in the morning until they go to bed late at night is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
astounding. Their “samovars,” and latterly the regular tea-kettles
of our American make, are bubbling and boiling from the moment
the housewife bestirs herself at daybreak until the fire goes out when
she sleeps. It should be stated in this connection that they are
supplied with a regular allowance of coal every year by the company,
<em>gratis</em>, each family being entitled to a certain amount, which
alone, if economically used, keeps them warm all winter in their
new houses; but for those who are extravagant, and are itching to
spend their extra wages, an extra supply is always kept in the store-houses
of the company for sale. Their appreciation of and desire
to possess all the canned fruit that is landed from the steamer is
marked to a great degree. If they had the opportunity, I doubt
whether a single family on that island to-day would hesitate to
bankrupt itself in purchasing this commodity. Potatoes they sometimes
demand, as well as onions, and perhaps if these vegetables
could be brought here and kept to an advantage the people would
soon become very fond of them. Most of these articles of food
mentioned heretofore are purchased by the natives in the company’s
store at either island. This food and the wearing apparel,
crockery, etc., which the company bring up here for the use of the
people, is sold to them at the exact cost price of the same, plus the
expenses of transportation, and many times within my knowledge
they have bought goods here at these stores at less rates than they
would have been subjected to in San Francisco. The object of the
company is not, under any circumstances, to make a single cent of
profit out of the sale of these goods to the natives. They aim only
to clear the cost and no more. Instructions to this effect are given
to its agents, while those of the Government are called upon to take
notice of the fact.</p>

<p>The store at St. Paul, as well as that at St. George, has its regular
annual “opening” after the arrival of the steamer in the spring,
to which the natives seem to pay absorbed attention. They crowd
the buildings day and night, eagerly looking for all the novelties in
food and apparel. These slouchy men and shawl-hooded women,
who pack the area before the counters, appear to feel as deep an
interest in the process of shopping as the most enthusiastic votaries
of that business do in our own streets. It certainly seems to
give them the greatest satisfaction of their lives on the Pribylov
Islands.</p>

<p>With regard to ourselves up here in so far as a purely physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
existence goes, the American method of living on and in the climate
of the Pribylov Islands is highly conducive to strength and health.
Tea and coffee, seasoned with condensed milk and lump sugar; hot
biscuits, cakes and waffles; potatoes, served in every method of
cookery; salt salmon, codfish, and corned beef; mess pork, and,
once a week, a fresh roast of beef or steaks; all the canned vegetables
and fruits; all the potted sauces, jams and jellies; pies, puddings
and pastries; and the exhaustive list of purely seafaring
dishes, such as pea and bean, barley and rice soups, curries and
maccaroni; these constitute the staples and many of the luxuries with
which the agents of the Alaska Commercial Company prolong their
existence while living here in the discharge of their duties, and to
which they welcome their guests for discussion and glad digestion.</p>

<p>A piano on St. Paul, in the company house; an assorted library,
embracing over one thousand volumes, selected from standard authors
in fiction, science, and history, together with many other unexpected
adjuncts of high comfort for body and soul, will be found
on these islands, wholly unlocked for by those who first set foot
upon them. A small Russian printed library has also been given
by the company to the natives on each island for their special entertainment.
The rising generation of sealers, however, if they read
at all, will read our own typography.</p>

<p>Before leaving the consideration of these people, who are so intimately
associated with and blended into the business on these
islands, it may be well to clearly define the relation existing between
them, the Government, and the company leasing the islands. When
Congress granted to the Alaska Commercial Company of San Francisco
the exclusive right of taking a certain number of fur-seals
every year, for a period of twenty years on these islands, it did so
with several reservations and conditions, which were confided in
their detail to the Secretary of the Treasury. This officer and the
president of the Alaska Commercial Company agreed upon a code
of regulations which should govern their joint action in regard to
the natives. It was a simple agreement that these people should
have a certain amount of dried salmon furnished them for food
every year, a certain amount of fuel, a school-house, and the right
to go to and come from the islands as they chose; and also the
right to work or not, understanding that in case they did not work,
their places would and could be supplied by other people who would
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>The company, however, has gone far beyond this exaction of the
Government; it has added an inexpressible boon of comfort, in the
formation of those dwellings now occupied by the natives, which was
not expressed nor thought of at the time of the granting of the
lease. An enlightened business-policy suggested to the company
that it would be much better for the natives, and much better for
company too, if these people were taken out of their filthy, unwholesome
hovels, put into habitable dwellings, and taught to live
cleanly, for the simple reason that by so doing the natives, living in
this improved condition, would be able physically and mentally,
every season when the sealing work began, to come out from their
long inanition and go to work at once with vigor and energetic persistency.
The sequel has proved the wisdom of the company.</p>

<p>Before this action on their part, it was physically impossible for
the inhabitants of St. Paul or St. George Islands to take the lawful
quota of one hundred thousand seal-skins annually in less than
three or four working months. They take them in less than thirty
working days now with the same number of men. What is the
gain? Simply this, and it is everything: the fur-seal skin, from the
14th of June, when it first arrives, as a rule, up to the 1st of August,
is in prime condition; from that latter date until the middle of
October it is rapidly deteriorating, to slowly appreciate again in
value as it sheds and renews its coat; so much so that it is practically
worthless in the markets of the world. Hence, the catch
taken by the Alaska Commercial Company every year is a prime one,
first to last—there are no low-grade “stagey” skins in it; but under
the old regimen, three-fourths of the skins were taken in
August, in September and even in October, and were not worth
their transportation to London. Comment on this is unnecessary;
it is the contrast made between a prescient business-policy, and one
that was as shiftless and improvident as language can well devise.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>The company found so much difficulty in getting the youth of
the villages to attend their schools, taught by our own people, especially
brought up there and hired by the company, that they
have adopted the plan of bringing one or two of the brightest boys
down every year and putting them into our schools, so that they
may grow up here and be educated, in order to return and serve as
teachers there. This policy is warranted by the success which attended
an experiment made at the time when I was up there first,
whereby a son of the chief was carried down and over to Rutland, Vt.,
for his education, remained there four years, then returned and took
charge of the school on St. Paul, which he has had until recently,
with the happiest results in increased attendance and attention from
the children. But, of course, so long as the Russian Church service is
conducted in the Russian language, we will find on the islands more
Russian-speaking people than our own. The non-attendance at
school was not and is not to be ascribed to indisposition on the
part of the children and parents. One of the oldest and most intelligent
of the natives told me, explanatory of their feeling and
consequent action, that he did not, nor did his neighbors, have any
objection to the attendance of their children on our English school;
but, if their boys and young men neglected their Russian lessons
they knew not who were going to take their places, when they died,
in his church, at the christenings, and at their burial. To any one
familiar with the teachings of the Greek Catholic faith, the objection
of old Philip Vollkov seems reasonable. I hope, therefore, that,
in the course of time, the Russian Church service may be voiced in
English; not that I want to substitute any other religion for it—far
from it; in my opinion it is the best one we could have for
these people—but until this substitution of our language for the
Russian is done, no very satisfactory work, in my opinion, will
be accomplished in the way of an English education on the Seal
Islands.</p>

<p>The Alaska Commercial Company deserves and will receive a
brief but comprehensive notice at this point. In order that we may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
follow it to these islands, and clearly and correctly appreciate the
circumstance which gave it footing and finally the control of the
business, I will pass back and review a chain of evidence adduced
in this direction from the time of our first occupation, in 1867, of
the territory of Alaska.</p>

<p>It will be remembered by many people, that when we were ratifying
the negotiation between our Government and that of Russia,
it became painfully apparent that nobody in this country knew
anything about the subject of Russian America. Every school-boy
knew where it was located, but no professor or merchant, however
wise or shrewd, knew what was in it. Accordingly, immediately
after the purchase was made and the formal transfer effected, a large
number of energetic and speculative men, some coming from New
England even, but most of them residents of the Pacific coast,
turned their attention to Alaska. They went up to Sitka in a little
fleet of sail and steam vessels, but among their number it appears
there were only two of our citizens who knew of or had the faintest
appreciation as to the value of the Seal Islands. One of these, Mr.
H. M. Hutchinson, a native of New Hampshire, and the other, a Captain
Ebenezer Morgan, a native of Connecticut, turned their faces
in 1868 toward them; also an ex-captain of the Russian-American
Company, Gustav Niebaum, who became a citizen immediately after
the transfer, knowing of their value, chartered a small vessel, and
hastened so as to land there a few days even before Captain Morgan
arrived in the <em>Peru</em>, a whaling ship.</p>

<p>Mr. Hutchinson gathered his information at Sitka—Captain Morgan
had gained his years before by experience on the South Sea sealing
grounds. Mr. Hutchinson represented a company of San Francisco
or California capitalists when he landed on St. Paul; Captain
Morgan represented another company of New London capitalists
and whaling merchants. They arrived almost simultaneously,
Morgan a few days or weeks anterior to Hutchinson. He had
quietly enough commenced to survey and pre-empt the rookeries on
the islands, or, in other words, the work of putting stakes down
and recording the fact of claiming the ground, as miners do in the
mountains; but later agreed to co-operate with Mr. Hutchinson.
These two parties passed that season of 1868 in exclusive control
of those islands, and they took an immense number of seals. They
took so many that it occurred to Mr. Hutchinson unless something
was done to check and protect these wonderful rookeries, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
saw here for the first time, and which filled him with amazement,
that they would be wiped out by the end of another season; although
he was the gainer then, and would be perhaps at the end,
if they should be thus eliminated, yet he could not forbear saying
to himself that it was wrong and should not be. To this Captain
Morgan also assented, and Captain Niebaum joined with them
cordially. In the fall of 1868 Mr. Hutchinson and Captain Morgan,
by their personal efforts, interested and aroused the Treasury
Department and Congress, so that a special resolution was
enacted declaring the Seal Islands a governmental reservation,
and prohibiting any and all parties from taking seals thereon
until further action by Congress. In 1869, seals were taken on
those islands, under the direction of the Treasury Department,
for the subsistence of the natives only; and in 1870 Congress
passed the present law, for the protection of the fur-bearing animals
on those islands, and under its provisions, and in accordance therewith,
after an animated and bitter struggle in competition, the
Alaska Commercial Company, of which Mr. Hutchinson was a prime
organizer, secured the award and received the franchise which it
now enjoys and will enjoy for some time yet. The company is an
American corporation, with a charter, rules, and regulations. They
employ a fleet of vessels, sail and steam: four steamers, a dozen or
fifteen ships, barks, and sloops. Their principal occupation and
attention is given naturally to the Seal Islands, though they have
stations scattered over the Aleutian Islands and that portion of
Alaska west and north of Kadiak. No post of theirs is less than
five hundred or six hundred miles from Sitka.</p>

<p>Outside of the Seal Islands all trade in this territory of Alaska
is entirely open to the public. There is no need of protecting the
fur-bearing animals elsewhere, unless it may be by a few wholesome
general restrictions in regard to the sea-otter chase. The
country itself protects the animals on the mainland and other
islands by its rugged, forbidding, and inhospitable exterior.</p>

<p>The treasury officials on the Seal Islands are charged with the
careful observance of every act of the company; a copy of the lease
and its covenant is conspicuously posted in their office; is translated
into Russian, and is familiar to all the natives. The company
directs its own labor, in accordance with the law, as it sees fit; selects
its time of working, etc. The natives themselves work under
the direction of their own chosen foremen, or “toyones.” These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
chiefs call out the men at the break of every working-day, divide
them into detachments according to the nature of the service, and
order their working. All communications with the laborers on
the sealing-ground and the company passes through their hands,
those chiefs having every day an understanding with the agent
of the company as to his wishes, and they govern themselves
thereby.</p>

<p>The company pays forty cents for the labor of taking each skin.
The natives take the skins on the ground, each man tallying his
work and giving the result at the close of the day to his chief or
foreman. When the skins are brought up and counted into the
salt-houses, where the agent of the company receives them from the
hands of the natives, the two tallies usually correspond very closely,
if they are not entirely alike. When the quota of skins is taken, at
the close of two, three, or four weeks of labor, as the case may be,
the total sum for the entire catch is paid over in a lump to the
chiefs, and these men divide it among the laborers according to
their standing as workmen, which they themselves have exhibited
on their special tally-sticks. For instance, at the annual divisions
or “catch” settlement, made by the natives on St. Paul Island
among themselves, in 1872, when I was present, the proceeds of
their work for that season in taking and skinning seventy-five
thousand seals, at forty cents per skin, with extra work connected
with it, making the sum of $30,637.37, was divided among them in
this way: There were seventy-four shares made up, representing
seventy-four men, though in fact only fifty-six men worked, but
they wished to give a certain proportion to their church, a certain
proportion to their priest, and a certain proportion to their widows;
so they water their stock, commercially speaking.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>It will be remembered that at the time the question of leasing
the islands was before Congress much opposition to the proposal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
was made, on several grounds, by two classes, one of which argued
against a “monopoly,” the other urging that the Government itself
would realize more by taking the whole management of the business
into its own hands. At that time far away from Washington,
in the Rocky Mountains, I do not know what arguments were used
in the committee-rooms, or who made them; but, since my careful
and prolonged study of the subject on the ground itself, and of the
trade and its conditions, I am now satisfied that the act of June,
1870, directing the Secretary of the Treasury to lease the seal-islands
of Alaska to the highest bidder, under the existing conditions
and qualifications, did the best and the only correct and
profitable thing that could have been done in the matter, both with
regard to the preservation of the seal-life in its original integrity,
and the pecuniary advantage of the treasury itself. To make this
statement perfectly clear, the following facts, by way of illustration,
should be presented:</p>

<p>First. When the Government took possession of these interests
in 1868 and 1869, the gross value of a seal-skin laid down in the
best market, at London, was less in some instances and in others
but slightly above the present tax and royalty paid upon it by the
Alaska Commercial Company.</p>

<p>Second. Through the action of the intelligent business-men
who took the contract from the Government in stimulating and encouraging
the dressers of the raw material, and in taking sedulous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
care that nothing but good skins should leave the island, and in combination
with leaders of fashion abroad, the demand for the fur, by
this manipulation and management, has been wonderfully increased.</p>

<p>Third. As matters now stand, the greatest and best interests of
the lessees are identical with those of the Government; what injures
one instantly injures the other. In other words, both strive
to guard against anything that shall interfere with the preservation
of the seal-life in its original integrity, and both having it to their
interest, if possible, to increase that life; if the lessees had it in
their power, which they certainly have not, to ruin these interests
by a few seasons of rapacity, they are so bonded and so environed
that prudence prevents it.</p>

<p>Fourth, The frequent changes in the office of the Secretary of
the Treasury, who has very properly the absolute control of the
business as it stands, do not permit upon his part that close,
careful scrutiny which is exercised by the lessees, who, unlike him,
have but their one purpose to carry out. The character of the
leading men among them is enough to assure the public that the
business is in responsible hands, and in the care of persons who
will use every effort for its preservation and its perpetuation, as it
is so plainly their best end to serve. Another great obstacle to the
success of the business, if controlled entirely by the Government,
would be encountered in disposing of the skins after they had been
brought down from the islands. It would not do to sell them up
there to the highest bidder, since that would license the sailing of
a thousand ships to be present at the sale. The rattling of their
anchor-chains and the scraping of their keels upon the beaches of
the two little islands would alone drive every seal away and over to
the Russian grounds in a remarkably short space of time. The Government
would therefore need to offer them at public auction in
this country: that would be simple history repeating itself—the
Government would be at the mercy of any well-organized combination
of buyers. Its agents conducting the sale could not counteract
the effect of such a combination as can the agents of a private
corporation, who may look after their interest in all the markets of
the world in their own time and in their own way, according to the
exigencies of the season and the demand, and who are supplied
with money which they can use, without public scandal, in the
manipulation of the market. On this ground I feel confident in
stating that the Treasury of the United States receives more money,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
net, under the system now in operation than it would by taking the
exclusive control of the business. Were any capable government
officer supplied with, say, $100,000, to expend in “working the
market,” and intrusted with the disposal of one hundred thousand
seal-skins wherever he could do so to the best advantage of the
Government, and were this agent a man of first-class ability and
energy, I think it quite likely that the same success might attend
his labor in the London market that distinguishes the management
of the Alaska Commercial Company. But imagine the cry of fraud
and embezzlement that would be raised against him, however honest
he might be! This alone would bring the whole business into
positive disrepute, and make it a national scandal. As matters are
now conducted there is no room for scandal—not one single transaction
on the islands but what is as clear to investigation and accountability
as the light of the noonday sun; what is done is
known to everybody, and the tax now laid by the Government upon,
and paid into the treasury every year by the Alaska Commercial
Company yields alone a handsome rate of interest on the entire
purchase-money expended for the ownership of all Alaska.</p>

<p>It is frequently urged with great persistency, by misinformed
and malicious authority, that the lessees can and do take thousands
of skins in excess of the law, and this catch in excess is shipped
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub rosa</i> to Japan from the Pribylov Islands. To show the folly of
such a move on the part of the Company, if even it were possible,
I will briefly recapitulate the conditions under which the skins are
taken. The natives of St. Paul and St. George do themselves, in
the manner I have indicated, all the driving and skinning of the
seals for the company. No others are permitted or asked to land
upon the islands to do this work, so long as the inhabitants of the
islands are equal to it. They have been equal to it and they are
more than equal to it. Every skin taken by the natives is counted
by themselves, as they get forty cents per pelt for that labor, and,
at the expiration of each day’s work in the field, the natives know
exactly how many skins have been taken by them, how many
of these skins have been rejected by the company’s agent because
they were carelessly cut and damaged in skinning—usually
about three-fourths of one per cent. of the whole catch—and they
have it recorded every evening by those among them who are
charged with the duty. Thus, were one hundred and one thousand
skins taken, instead of one hundred thousand allowed by law, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
natives would know it as quickly as it was done, and they would,
on the strength of their record and their tally, demand the full
amount of their compensation for the extra labor; and were any
ship to approach the islands, at any hour, these people would know
it at once, and would be aware of any shipment of skins that might
be attempted. It would then be the common talk among the three
hundred and ninety-eight inhabitants of the two islands, and it
would be a matter of record, open to any person who might come
upon the ground charged with investigation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, these natives are constantly going to and from
Oonalashka, visiting their relations in the Aleutian settlements,
hunting for wives, etc. On the mainland they have intimate intercourse
with bitter enemies of the company, with whom they would
not hesitate to talk over the whole state of affairs on the islands, as
they always do; for they know nothing else and think of nothing
else and dream of nothing else. Therefore, should anything be
done contrary to the law, the act could and would be reported by
these people. The Government, on its part, through its four agents
stationed on these islands, counts these skins into the ship, and one
of their number goes down to San Francisco upon her. There the
collector of the port details experts of his own, who again count
them all out of the hold, and upon that record the tax is paid and
the certificate signed by the Government.</p>

<p>It will therefore at once be seen, by examining the state of affairs
on the islands, and the conditions upon which the lease is
granted, that the most scrupulous care in fulfilling the terms of the
contract is compassed, and that this strict fulfilment is the most
profitable course for the lessees to pursue; and that it would be
downright folly in them to deviate from the letter of the law, and thus
lay themselves open at any day to discovery, the loss of their contract,
and forfeiture of their bonds. Their action can be investigated
at any time, any moment, by Congress; of which they are fully aware.
They cannot bribe these three hundred and ninety-eight people on
the islands to secrecy, any more successfully than they could conceal
their action from them on the sealing fields; and any man of average
ability could go, and can go, among these natives and inform himself
as to the most minute details of the catch, from the time the
lease was granted up to the present hour, should he have reason to
suspect the honesty of the Treasury agents. The road to and from the
islands is not a difficult one, though it is travelled only once a year.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_85" href="#FNanchor_85" class="label">[85]</a> It was with peculiar pleasure that the writer undertook, at the suggestion
of Professor Baird, who is the honored and beloved secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, the task of examining into and reporting upon this
subject; and it is also gratifying to add, that the statements of fact and the
hypotheses evolved therefrom by him in 1874 have, up to the present time,
been verified by an inflexible sequence of events on the ground itself. The
concurrent testimony of the numerous agents of the Treasury Department and
the Government generally, who have trodden in his footsteps, amply testifies
to their stability.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="label">[86]</a> Pribylov, the discoverer of the Seal Islands, was a native of “old Russia.”
His father was one of the surviving sailors of the <em>St. Peter</em>, which
was wrecked, with Bering in command, November 4, 1741, on Bering Island.
The only reference which I can find to him is the vague incidental expressions,
used here and there throughout an extended series of lengthy Russian letters
published by Techmainov, as illustrative of the condition of affairs in regard
to the Russian American Company. Pribylov was, when cruising in 1783-86
for the rumored seal-grounds, merely the first mate of the sloop <em>St. George</em>.
The captain and part owner was one M. Subov, who was a member of a trading
association then well organized in Alaska, and widely known as the “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laybaidev
Lastochin</i>” Company. It does not appear that Pribylov took any part
in the business of sealing other than that of remaining in charge of the company’s
vessels. He died while in discharge of these duties at Sitka, March,
1796, on his ship <em>The Three Saints</em>.</p>

<p>Pribylov himself called these islands of his discovery after Subov; but
the Russians then, and soon after unanimously, indicated the group by its
present well-deserved title, “<cite>Ostrovie Pribylova</cite>.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_87" href="#FNanchor_87" class="label">[87]</a> Veniaminov says that he does feel inclined to believe this story, as the
peaks of Oonimak can be seen occasionally from St. Paul. I have no hesitation
in saying that they were never observed by any mortal eye from the
Pribylov group. The wide expanse of water between these points, and the
thick, foggy air of Bering Sea, especially so at the season mentioned in this
story above, will always make the mountains of Oonimak invisible to the eye
from Saint Paul Island. A <em>mirage</em> is almost an impossibility. It may have
been much more probable if the date was a winter one.—Veniaminov: Zapieskie
ob Oonalashkenskaho Otdayla, etc., 1842.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_88" href="#FNanchor_88" class="label">[88]</a> A large amount of information in regard to the climate of these islands
has been collected and recorded by the signal service, United States Army,
and similar observations are still continued by the agents of the Alaska Commercial
Company.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_89" href="#FNanchor_89" class="label">[89]</a> The rise and fall of tide at the Seal Islands I carefully watched one
whole season at St. Paul. The irregularity, however, of ebb and flow is the
most prominent feature of the matter. The highest rise in the spring-tides
was a trifle over four feet, while that of the neap-tides not much over two.
Owing to the nature of the case, it is impossible to prepare a tidal calendar for
Alaska, above the Aleutian Islands, which will even faintly foreshadow a correct
registration in advance.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90" class="label">[90]</a> The mosses at Kamminista, St. Paul, are the finest examples of their
kind on the islands; they are very perfect, and many species are beautiful.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91" class="label">[91]</a> That spruce-trees can be made to live transplanted from indigenous localities
to the barren slopes of the Aleutian Islands, has been demonstrated;
but in living these trees do nothing else, and scarcely grow to any appreciable
degree. A few spruce were transferred to Oonalashka when Veniaminov was
at work there in 1830-35. They are still standing and keep green, but the
change which such a long lapse of time should produce by growth has been
as difficult to determine as it is to find evidence of increased altitude to the
mountains around them since these Sitkan trees were planted with pious hope
at their feet fifty years ago. Though I can readily understand why the salmon-berries
of Oonalashka should not do well on the Seal Islands (though I
think they would at the Garden Cove of St. George), yet I believe that
the huckleberries of that section would thrive at many places if carefully
transplanted to these localities: the southern slopes of Cemetery Ridge at
Zapadnie; the southern slopes of Telegraph Hill, and eastern fall of Tolstoi
peninsula down to the shore of the lagoon. They might also do well set out
at picked places around the Big Lake and on Northeast Point, around the little
lake thereon. If these bushes really throve here, they would be the means
of adding greatly to the comfort of the inhabitants; for the Oonalashka huckleberry
is an exceeding pleasant, juicy fruit, large and well adapted for canning
and preserving. Having less sunshine here than at Illoolook, it may not ripen
up as well flavored, but will, I think, succeed. The roots of the bushes when
brought up from Oonalashka in April or early May should be kept moist by
wet-moss wrappings from the moment they are first taken up until they are
reset, with the tops well pruned back, on the Pribylov Islands. The experiment
is surely worth all the trouble of making, and I hope it will be done.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_92" href="#FNanchor_92" class="label">[92]</a> Blue foxes were also, and are, natives of the Commander Islands. Steller
describes their fearlessness when the shipwrecked crew of the <em>St. Peter</em>
landed there, November 6, 1741.</p>

<p>In regard to these foxes the Pribylov natives declare that when the islands
were first occupied by their ancestors, 1786-87, the fur was invariably <em>blue</em>;
that the present smoky blue, or ashy indigo color, is due to the coming of
white foxes across on the ice from the mainland to the eastward. The white-furred
<em>vulpes</em> is quite numerous on the islands to-day. I should judge that
perhaps one-fifth of the whole number were of this color; they do not live
apart from the blue ones, but evidently breed “in and in.” I notice that
Veniaminov, also, makes substantially the same statement; only differing by
charging this deterioration of the blue foxes’ fur to a deportation from outside
of red foxes, on ice-floes, and adds that the natives always hunted down
these “krassnie peeschee” as soon as their presence was known; hence my
inability, perhaps, to see any sign of their posterity in 1872-76.</p>

<p>The presence of these animals on the Pribylov Islands is a real source of
happiness to the natives, especially so to the younger ones. The little pup-foxes
make pets and playfellows for the children, while hunting the adults
during the winter gives wholesome employment to the mind and body of the
native who does so. They are trapped in common dead-falls, steel spring-clips,
or beaver traps, and shot. A very large portion of the gossip on the
islands is in relation to this business.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_93" href="#FNanchor_93" class="label">[93]</a> The temerity of the fox is wonderful to contemplate, as it goes on a full
run or stealthy tread up and down and along the faces of almost inaccessible
bluffs, in search of old and young birds and their nests and eggs, for which the
“peeschee” have a keen relish. The fox always brings an egg up in its
mouth, and, carrying it back a few feet from the brink of the precipice, leisurely
and with gusto breaks the larger end and sucks the contents from the
shell. One of the curious sights of my notice, in this connection, was the sly,
artful, and insidious advances of Reynard at Tolstoi Mees, St. George, where,
conspicuous and elegant in its fluffy white dress, it cunningly stretched on its
back as though dead, making no sign of life whatever, save to gently hoist its
thick brush now and then; whereupon many dull, curious sea-birds, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Graculus
bicristatus</i>, in their intense desire to know all about it, flew in narrowing circles
overhead, lower and lower, closer and closer, until one of them came
within the sure reach of a sudden spring and a pair of quick snapping jaws,
while the gulls and others, rising safe and high above, screamed out in seeming
contempt for the struggles of the unhappy “shag,” and rendered hideous
approbation.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_94" href="#FNanchor_94" class="label">[94]</a> Using the egg of our domestic fowl, the hen, as a standard, the following
note made in regard to the size and quality of the eggs of the sea-birds of these
waters may not be uninteresting to many. When daily served on St. George,
during June and July, with eggs of indigenous sea-fowl, I recorded my gastronomic
comparisons which occurred then as I ate them. Here follows a recapitulation:</p>

<p>Fresh-laid eggs of “lupus,” or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">F. glacialis</i>: Best eggs known to the
islands; can be soft-boiled or fried, etc., and are as good as our own hens’
eggs; the yolk is light and clear; the size thereof is in shape and bulk like a
duck’s egg; it has a white shell. Season: June 1st to 15th, inclusive; scarce
on St. Paul, and not abundant on St. George.</p>

<p>Fresh-laid eggs of “arrie,” or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. arra</i>: Very good; can be soft-boiled or
fried; are best scrambled; yolks are dark; no strange taste whatever to them;
pyriform in shape; large as a goose-egg; shell gayly-colored; they are exceedingly
abundant on Walrus Island and St. George; tons of them. Season:
June 25th to July 10th, inclusive.</p>

<p>Fresh-laid eggs of gulls, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laridæ</i>: Perceptibly strong; cannot be relished
unless in omelettes; yolks very dark; size and shape of our hen’s egg; shell
dark, clay-colored ground, mottled. Season: June 5th to July 20th, inclusive;
they are in moderate supply only. The other eggs in the list, such as those
of the “choochkie,” the “shag,” and the several varieties of water-fowl which
breed here, are never secured in sufficient quantity to be of any consideration
as articles of diet. It is, perhaps, better that a scarcity of their kind continue,
judging from the strong smack of the choochkie’s, the repulsive taint of the
shag’s, and the “twang” of the sea-parrot’s, all of which I tasted as a matter
of investigation.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_95" href="#FNanchor_95" class="label">[95]</a> The St. George natives have caught codfish just off the Tolstoi Head
early in June; but it is a rare occurrence. By going out two or three miles
from the village at either island during July and August the native fisherman
usually captures large halibut—not in abundance, however. The St. Paul
people, as well as their relatives on St. George, fish in small “two-hole” bidarkies.
They go out together in squads of four to six. One man alone in
the kyack is not able to secure a “bolshoi poltoos.” The method, when the
halibut is hooked, is to call for your nearest neighbor in his bidarka, who
paddles swiftly up. You extend your paddle to him, retaining your own
hold, and he grasps it, while you seize his in turn, thus making it impossible
to capsize, while the large and powerfully struggling fish is brought to the
surface between the canoes and knocked on the head. It is then towed ashore
and carried in triumph to its lucky captor’s house.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_98" href="#FNanchor_98" class="label">[98]</a> To visit Walrus Island in a boat, pleasantly and successfully, it is best to
submit to the advice and direction of the natives. They leave the village in
the evening, and, taking advantage of the tide, proceed along the coast as far
as the bluffs of Polavina, where they rest on their oars, doze, and smoke until
the dawning of daylight, or later, perhaps, until the fog lifts enough for them
to get a glimpse of the islet which they seek. They row over then in about two
hours with their bidarrah. They leave, however, with perfect indifference as
to daylight or fog. Nothing but a southeaster can disturb their tranquillity
when they succeed in landing on Walrus Island. They would find it as difficult
to miss striking the extended reach of St. Paul on their return, as they found
it well-nigh impossible to push off from Polavina and find “Morzovia” in a
thick, windy fog and running sea.</p>

<p>Otter Island, or “Bobrovia,” is easily reached in almost any weather that
is not very stormy, for it looms up high above the water. It takes the bidarrah
about two hours to row over from the village, while I have gone across
once in a whale-boat with less than one hour’s expenditure of time, sail, and
oars <em>en route</em>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_99" href="#FNanchor_99" class="label">[99]</a> That profile of the south shore, between the village hill and Southwest
Point, taken from the steamer’s anchorage off the village cove, shows its
characteristic and remarkable alternation of rookery slope and low sea-level
flats. This point of viewing is slightly more than half a mile true west of the
village hill, to a sight which brings Bogaslov summits and Tolstoi Head
nearly in line. At Zapadnie is the place where the Russian discoverers first
landed in 1787, July 10th. With the exception of that bluffy west-end Einahnuhto
cliffs, the whole coast of St. Paul is accessible, and affords an easy
landing, except at the short reach of “Seethah” and the rookery points, as
indicated. The great sand beach of this island extends from Lukannon to
Polavina, thence to Webster’s house, Novastoshnah; from there over, and
sweeping back and along the north shore to Nahsayvernia headland, then between
Zapadnie and Tolstoi, together with the beautiful though short sand of
Zoltoi. This extensive and slightly broken sandy coast is not described as
peculiar to any other island in Alaska, or of Siberian waters.</p>

<p>There are no running streams at any season of the year on St. Paul; but
an abundance of fresh water is plainly afforded by the numerous lakes, all
of which are “svayjoi,” save the lagoon estuary. The four big reefs which
I have located are each awash in every storm that blows from seaward over
them; they are all rough, rocky ledges. That little one indicated in English
Bay caused the wrecking of a large British vessel in 1847, which was coming
in to anchor just without Zapadnie; a number of the crew were “masslucken,”
so my native informant averred. Most of the small amount of drift-wood
that is found on this island is procured at Northeast Point and Polavina;
the north shore from Maroonitch to Tsammanah has also been favored with
sea-waif logs in exceptional seasons, to the exclusion of all other sections of
the coast. The natives say that the St. George people get much more drift-wood
every year, as a rule, than they do on St. Paul. From what I could see
during my four seasons of inspection, they never have got much, under the
best of circumstances, on either island. They pay little attention to it now,
and gather what they do during the winter season, going to Polavina and the
north shore with sleds, on which they hoist sails after loading there, and scud
home before strong northerly blasts.</p>

<p>Captain Erskine informs me that the water is free and bold all around the
north shore, from Cross Hill to Southwest Point; no reefs or shoals up to within
half a mile of land anywhere. English Bay is very shallow, and no sea-going
vessel should attempt to enter it that draws over six feet.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_100" href="#FNanchor_100" class="label">[100]</a> The profile of the coast of St. George’s Island, which I give on the map,
presents clearly an idea of its characteristic, bold, abrupt elevation from the
sea. From the Garden Cove around to Zapadnie beach there is no natural
opportunity for a man to land; then, again, from Zapadnie beach round to
Starry Arteel there is not a sign of a chance for an agile man to come ashore
and reach the plateau above. From Starry Arteel to the Great Eastern rookery
there is an alternation, between the several breeding-grounds, of three low
and gradual slopes of the land to sea-level; these, with the landing at Garden
Cove and at Zapadnie, are the only spots of the St. George coast where we can
come ashore. An active person can scramble up at several steep places between
the Sea Lion rookery and Tolstoi Mees, but the rest of that extended
bluffy sea-wall, which I have just defined, is wholly inaccessible from the
water. A narrow strip of rough, rocky shingle, washed over by every storm-beaten
sea, is all that lies beneath the mural precipices.</p>

<p>In the spring, when snow melts on the high plateau, a beautiful cascade
is seen at Waterfall Head; its feathery, filmy, silver ribbon of plunging water
is thrown out into exquisite relief by the rich background of that brownish
basalt and tufa over which it drops. Another pretty little waterfall is to be
seen just west of the village, at this season only, where it leaps from a low
range of bluffs to the sea. The first-named cascade is more than four hundred
feet in sheer unbroken precipitation.</p>

<p>One or two small, naked, pinnacle rocks, standing close in, and almost
joined to the beach at the Sea Lion rookery, constitute the only outlying islets
or rocks; a stony kelp-bed at Zapadnie, and one off the Little Eastern rookery,
both of limited reach seaward, are the only hindrances to a ship’s sailing
boldly round the island, even to scraping the bluffs, at places, safely with her
yard-arms. I have located the Zapadnie shoal by observation from the bluffs
above; while Captain Baker, of the <em>Reliance</em>, sounded out the other.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101" class="label">[101]</a> Surprise has often been genuine among those who inquire, over the fact
that there is no law officer here at either village, and wonder is expressed why
such provision is not made by the Government. But when the following facts
relative to this subject are understood, it is at once clear that a justice of the
peace and his constabulary would be entirely useless if established on the
seal-islands. As these natives live here, they live as a single family in each
settlement, having one common purpose in life and only one; what one native
does, eats, wears, or says, is known at once to all the others, just as whatsoever
any member of our household may do will soon be known to us all who
belong to its organization; hence if they steal or quarrel among themselves,
they keep the matter wholly to themselves, and settle it to their own satisfaction.
Were there rival villages on the islands and diverse people and employment,
then the case would be reversed, and the need of legal machinery apparent.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_102" href="#FNanchor_102" class="label">[102]</a> The population of St. Paul in 1880 was 298. Of these, 14 were whites
(13 males and 1 female), 128 male Aleutians, and 156 females. On St. George
we have 92 souls: 4 white males, 35 male Aleutians, and 53 females, a total
population on these islands of 390. This is an increase of between thirty and
forty people since 1873. Prior to 1873 they had neither much increased nor
diminished for fifty years, but would have fallen off rapidly (since the births
were never equal to the deaths) had not recruits been regularly drawn from
the mainland and other islands every season when the ships came up.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_103" href="#FNanchor_103" class="label">[103]</a> This evil of habitual and gross intoxication under Russian rule was not
characteristic of these islands alone. It was universal throughout Alaska. Sir
George Simpson, speaking of the subject when in Sitka, April, 1842, says:
“Some reformation certainly was wanted in this respect, for of all the
drunken as well as of all the dirty places that I had visited, New Archangel
(Sitka) was the worst. On the holidays in particular, of which, Sundays included,
there are one hundred and sixty-five in the year, men, women, and
even children were to be seen staggering about in all directions.”—Simpson:
Journey Around the World, 1841-42, p. 88.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_104" href="#FNanchor_104" class="label">[104]</a> I was told by a very bright Russian, who spent a season here, 1871-72,
as special agent of the Treasury Department, that the Aleutian ancestors of
these people when they were converted and baptized into the Greek Catholic
Church received their names, brand new, from the fertile brains of priests,
who, after exhausting the common run of Muscovitic titles, such as our Smiths
and Joneses, were compelled to fall back upon some personal characteristics of
the new claimant for civilized nomenclature. Thus we have to-day on the
Seal Islands a “Stepan Bayloglazov,” or, “Son of a White Eye,” “Oseep
Baizyahzeekov,” or “Son of Man without a Tongue.” A number of the old
Russian governors and admirals of the imperial navy are represented here by
their family names, though I do not think, from my full acquaintance with
the namesakes, that the distinguished owners in the first place had anything
to do with their physical embodiment on the Pribylov Islands.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_105" href="#FNanchor_105" class="label">[105]</a> Living as the Seal-islanders do, and doing what they do, the seal’s life is
naturally their great study and objective point. It nourishes and sustains
them. Without it they say they could not live, and they tell the truth. Hence,
their attention to the few simple requirements of the law, so wise in its provisions,
is not forced or constrained, but is continuous. Self-interest in this respect
appeals to them keenly and eloquently. They know everything that is
done and everything that is said by anybody and by everybody in their little
community. Every seal-drive that is made, and every skin that is taken, is
recorded and accounted for by them to their chiefs and their church, when
they make up their tithing-roll at the close of each day’s labor. Nothing can
come to the islands, by day or by night, without being seen by them and
spoken of. I regard the presence of these people on the islands at the transfer,
and their subsequent retention and entailment in connection with the seal-business,
as an exceedingly good piece of fortune, alike advantageous to the
Government, to the company, and to themselves.</p>

<p>In August, 1873, while on St. George Island, I was present at a similar

<p>These twenty-nine shares referred to, as stated above, represent only twenty-five
able-bodied men; two of them were women. This method of division as
above given is the result of their own choice. It is an impossible thing for the
company to decide their relative merits as workmen on the ground, so they
have wisely turned its entire discussion over to them. Whatever they do they
must agree to—whatever the company might do they possibly and probably
would never clearly understand, and hence dissatisfaction and suspicion would
inevitably arise. As it is, the whole subject is most satisfactorily settled.</p>

<p class="no-indent">A vivid realism of the fact that often truth is far stranger than fiction
is strikingly illustrated in the life-history of the fur-seal: as it is
the one overshadowing and superlatively interesting subject of this
discussion, I shall present all its multitudinous details, even at the
risk of being thought tedious. That aggregate of animal life
shadowed every summer out upon the breeding grounds of the
Seal Islands is so vast, so anomalous, so interesting, and so valuable,
that it deserves the fullest mention; and even when I shall
have done, it will be but feebly expressed.</p>

</figure>

<p>Great as it is, yet a short schedule<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> embraces the titles of all
the pinnipeds found in, on, and around the island-group. Of this
list the hair-seal<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> is the animal which has done so much to found
that erroneous popular and scientific opinion as to what a fur-seal
appears like. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phoca vitulina</i> has, in this manner, given to the people
of the world a false idea of its relatives. It is so commonly distributed
all over the littoral salt waters of the earth, seen in the
harbors of nearly every marine port, or basking along the loneliest
and least inhabited of desolate coasts far to the north, that everybody
has noticed it, if not in life, then in its stuffed skins at the
museums, sometimes very grotesquely mounted. This copy, set
everywhere before the eye of the naturalist, has rendered it so difficult
for him to correctly discriminate between the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phocidæ</i> and the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Otariidæ</i>, that the synonymy of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinnipedia</i> has been expanded
until it is replete with meaningless description and surmise.</p>

<p>Although the hair-seal belongs to the great group of pinnipeds,
yet it does not have even a generic affinity with those seals with
which it has been so persistently grouped, namely, the fur-seal and
the sea-lion. It no more resembles them, than does the raccoon
a black or grizzly bear.</p>

<p>I shall not enter into a detailed description of this seal; it is
wholly superfluous, for excellent, and, I believe, trustworthy accounts
have been repeatedly published by writers who have treated
of the subject as it was spread before their eyes on the coasts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
Labrador, Newfoundland, and Greenland; to say nothing of the researches
and notes made by European scientists. It differs completely
in shape and habit from its congeners on these islands.
Here, where I have studied its biology, it seldom comes up from
the water more than a few rods at the farthest; generally hauling
and resting at the margin of the surf-wash. It takes up no position
on land to hold and protect a family or harem, preferring the detached
water-worn rocks, especially those on the lonely north shore
of St. Paul, although I have seen it resting at “Gorbatch,” near the
sea-margin of the great seal-rookery of that name, on the Reef
Point of St. Paul; its cylindrical, supine, gray and white body
marked in strong contrast with the erect, black, and ochre-colored
forms of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Callorhinus</i>, which swarmed round about it. On such
small spots of rock, wet and isolated from the mainland, and in secluded
places of the north shore, the “nearhpah” brings forth its
young, a single pup, perfectly white, covered with long woolly hair,
and weighing from three to seven pounds. This pup grows rapidly,
and after the lapse of four or five months it tips the scales at
fifty pounds; by that time it has shed its infant coat and donned
the adult soft steel-gray hair over the head, limbs, and abdomen,
with its back most richly mottled and barred lengthwise, by dark
brown and brown-black streaks and blotches, suffused at their edges
into the light steel-gray ground of the body. When they appear in
the spring following, this bright gray tone to their color has ripened
into a dingy ochre, and the mottling spread well over the head
and down on the upper side or back of the flippers, but fades out
as it progresses. It has no appreciable fur or under-wool. There
is no noteworthy difference as to color or size between the sexes.
So far as I have observed, they are not polygamous. They are exceedingly
timid and wary at all times, and in this manner and
method they are diametrically opposed, not by shape alone, but
by habit and disposition, to the fashion of the fur-seal in especial,
and the sea-lion. Their skin is of little value, comparatively, but
their chief merit, according to the natives, is the relative greater
juiciness and sweetness of their flesh, over even the best steaks of
sea-lion or fur-seal pup meat.</p>

<p>One common point of agreement among all authors was, by my
observations of fact, so strikingly refuted, that I will here correct a
prevalent error made by naturalists who, comparing the hair-seal
with the fur-seal, state that in consequence of the peculiar structure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
of their limbs, their progression on land is “mainly accomplished
by a wriggling, serpentine motion of the body, slightly assisted
by the extremities.” This is not so in any respect; for,
whenever I have purposely surprised these animals, a few rods from
the beach-margin, they would awake and excitedly scramble, or
rather spasmodically exert themselves, to reach the water instantly,
by striking out quickly with both fore-feet simultaneously, lifting
in this way alone, and dragging the whole body forward, without
any “wriggling motion” whatever to their back or posterior parts,
moving from six inches to a foot in advance every time their fore-feet
were projected forward, and the body drawn along according
to the violence of the effort and the character of the ground; the
body of the seal then falls flat upon its stomach, and the fore-feet
or flippers are free again for another similar motion. This action of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phoca</i> is effected so continuously and so rapidly, that in attempting
to head off a young “nearhpah” from the water, at English Bay, I
was obliged to leave a brisk walk and take to a dog trot to do it.
The hind-feet are not used when exerted in this rapid movement at
all; they are dragged along in the wake of the body, perfectly limp
and motionless. But they do use those posterior parts, however,
when leisurely climbing up and over rocks undisturbed, or playing
one with another; still it is always a weak, trembling terrestrial effort,
and particularly impotent and clumsy. In their swift swimming
the hind-feet of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phocidæ</i> evidently do all the work; the reverse
is a remarkable characteristic of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Otariidæ</i>.</p>

<p>These remarks of mine, it should be borne in mind, apply directly
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phoca vitulina</i>, and I presume indirectly with equal
force to all the rest of its more important generic kindred, be they
as large as the big maklok, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erignathus barbata</i>, or less.</p>

<p>This hair-seal is found around these islands at all seasons of the
year, but in very small numbers. I have never seen more than
twenty-five or thirty at any one time, and I am told that its occidental
distribution, although everywhere found, above and below,
from the arctic to the tropics, and especially general over the
North Pacific coast, nowhere exhibits any great number at any one
place; but we know that it and its immediate kindred form a vast
majority of the multitudinous seal-life peculiar to our North Atlantic
shores, ice-floes, and contiguous waters. The scarcity of
this species, and of all its generic allies, in the waters of the Pacific,
is notable as compared with those of the circumpolar Atlantic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
where these hair-seals are the seals of commerce: they are found in
such immense numbers between Greenland and Labrador, and
thence to the eastward at certain seasons of every year, that employment
is given to a fleet of about sixty sailing and steam vessels,
which annually goes forth from St. John, Newfoundland, and
elsewhere, fitted for seal-fishing: taking in all this cruising over
three hundred thousand of these animals each season. The principal
object of value, however, is the oil rendered from them: the
skins have a very small commercial importance.</p>

<p>The fur-seal, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Callorhinus ursinus</i>, which repairs to these islands
to breed and to shed its hair and fur, in numbers that seem almost
fabulous, is the highest organized of all the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinnipedia</i>, and, indeed,
for that matter, when land and water are weighed in the account
together, there is no other animal known to man which may be truly
classed as its superior, from a purely physical point of view.
Certainly there are few, if any, creatures in the animal kingdom
that can be said to exhibit a higher order of instinct, approaching
even our intelligence.</p>

<p>I wish to draw attention to a specimen of the finest of this race—a
male in the flush and prime of his first maturity, six or seven
years old, and full grown. When it comes up from the sea early
in the spring, out to its station for the breeding season, we have an
animal before us that will measure six and a half to seven and a
quarter feet in length from tip of nose to the end of its abbreviated
abortive tail. It will weigh at least four hundred pounds, and I
have seen older specimens much more corpulent, which, in my best
judgment, could not be less than six hundred pounds in weight.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>The head of this animal now before us appears to be disproportionately
small in comparison with an immensely thick neck and shoulders;
but, as we come to examine it, we will find it is mostly all
occupied by the brain. The light frame-work of its skull supports
an expressive pair of large bluish-hazel eyes, alternately burning
with revengeful, passionate light, then suddenly changing to the
tones of tenderness and good-nature. It has a muzzle and jaws of
about the same size and form observed in any full-blooded Newfoundland
dog, with this difference, that the lips are not flabby and
overhanging; they are as firmly lined and pressed against one another
as our own. The upper lips support a yellowish-white and
gray mustache, composed of long, stiff bristles, which, when not
torn out and broken off in combat, sweeps down and over the
shoulders as a luxuriant plume. Look at it as it comes leisurely
swimming on toward the land; see how high above the water it
carries its head, and how deliberately it surveys the beach, after
having stepped upon it (for it may be truly said to step with its
fore-flippers, as they regularly alternate when it moves up), carrying
the head well above them, erect and graceful, at least three feet
from the ground. The fore-feet, or flippers, are a pair of dark
bluish-black hands, about eight or ten inches broad at their junction
with the body, and the metacarpal joint, running out to
an ovate point at their extremity, some fifteen to eighteen inches
from this union—all the rest of the forearm, the ulna, radius, and
humerus being concealed under the skin and thick blubber-folds of
the main body and neck, hidden entirely at this season, when it is
so fat. But six weeks to three months after this time of landing,
when that superfluous fat and flesh is consumed by self-absorption,
then those bones will show plainly under its shrunken skin. On
the upper side of these flippers the hair of the body straggles down
finer and fainter as it comes below to a point close by, and slightly
beyond that spot of junction where the phalanges and the metacarpal
bones unite, similar to that point on our own hand where
our knuckles are placed; and here the hair ends, leaving the rest
of the skin to the end of the flipper bare and wrinkled in places at
the margin of the inner side; showing, also, five small pits, containing
abortive nails, which are situated immediately over the
union of the phalanges with their cartilaginous continuations to the
end of the flipper.</p>

<p>On the under side of the flipper the skin is entirely bare from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
its outer extremity up to the body-connection. It is sensibly
tougher and thicker than elsewhere on the body; it is deeply and
regularly wrinkled with seams and furrows, which cross one another
so as to leave a kind of sharp diamond-cut pattern. When
they are placed by the animal upon the smoothest rocks, shining
and slippery from algoid growths and the sea-polish of restless
waters, they seldom fail to adhere.</p>

<p>When we observe this seal moving out on the land, we notice
that, though it handles its fore-feet in a most creditable manner, it
brings up its rear in quite a different style: for, after every second
step ahead with the anterior limbs it will arch its spine, and in arching,
it drags and lifts up, and together forward, the hind-feet, to a
fit position under its body, giving it in this manner fresh leverage
for another movement forward by the fore-feet, in which the spine
is again straightened out, and then a fresh hitch is taken up on
the posteriors once more, and so on as the seal progresses. This is
the leisurely and natural movement on land, when not disturbed, the
body all the time being carried clear of and never touching the
ground; but if the creature is frightened, this method of progression
is radically changed. It launches into a lope and actually gallops
so fast that the best powers of a man in running are taxed to
head it off. Still, it must be remembered that it cannot run far before
it sinks, trembling, gasping, breathless, to the earth. Thirty or
forty yards of such speed marks the utmost limit of its endurance.</p>

<p>The radical difference in the form and action of the hind-feet
cannot fail to strike the eye at once. They are one-seventh longer
than the fore-hands and very much lighter and more slender; they
resemble, in broad terms, a pair of black-kid gloves, flattened out
and shrivelled, as they lie in their box.</p>

<p>There is no suggestion of fingers on the fore-hands; but the
hind-feet seem to be toes run into ribbons, for they literally flap
about involuntarily from that point where the cartilaginous processes
unite with the phalangeal bones. The hind-feet are also
merged in the body at their junction with it, like those anterior.
Nothing can be seen of the leg above the tarsal joint.</p>

<p>The shape of the hind flipper is strikingly like that of a human
foot, provided the latter were drawn out to a length of twenty or
twenty-two inches, the instep flattened down and the toes run out
into thin, membranous, oval-tipped points, only skin-thick, leaving
three strong cylindrical, grayish, horn-colored nails, half an inch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
long each, back six inches from these skinny toe-ends, without any
sign of nails to mention on the outer big and little toes.</p>

<p>On the upper side of this hind-foot the body-hair comes down
to that point where the metatarsus and phalangeal bones join and
fade out. From that junction the phalanges, about six inches down
to the nails above mentioned, are entirely bare and stand ribbed up
in bold relief on the membrane which unites them, as the web to a
duck’s foot. The nails just referred to mark the ends of the phalangeal
bones and their union in turn with the cartilaginous processes,
which run rapidly tapering and flattening out to the ends of
the thin toe-points. Now, as we are looking at this fur-seal’s motion
and progression, that which seems most odd is the gingerly
manner (if I may be allowed to use the expression) in which it carries
these hind flippers. They are held out at right angles from
the body directly opposite the pelvis, the toe-ends or flaps slightly
waving, curled, and drooping over, supported daintily, as it were,
above the earth, the animal only suffering its weight behind to fall
upon its heels, which are themselves opposed to each other, scarcely
five inches apart.</p>

<p>We shall, as we see this seal again later in the season, have to
notice a different mode of progression and bearing, both when it is
lording over its harem or when it grows shy and restless at the end
of the breeding season, then faint, emaciated, and dejected. But
we will now proceed to observe him in the order of his arrival and
that of his family. His behavior during the long period of fasting
and unceasing activity and vigilance, and other cares which devolve
upon him as the most eminent of all polygamists in the brute world,
I shall carefully relate, and to fully comprehend the method of this
exceedingly interesting animal it will be frequently necessary for
the reader to refer to my sketch-maps of its breeding grounds or
rookeries, and the islands.</p>

<p>The adult males are the first examples of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Callorhinus</i> to arrive
in the spring on the seal-ground, which has been deserted by
all of them since the close of the preceding year.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>Between May 1st and 5th, usually, a few males will be found
scattered over the rookeries pretty close to the water. They are at
this time quite shy and sensitive, seeming not yet satisfied with the
land, and a great many spend day after day idly swimming out
among the breakers a little distance from the shore before they
come to it, perhaps somewhat reluctant at first to enter upon the
assiduous duties and the grave responsibilities before them of fighting
for and maintaining their positions in the rookeries.</p>

<p>The first arrivals are not always the oldest bulls, but may be said
to be the finest and most ambitious of their class. They are full
grown and able to hold their places on the rookeries or the breeding
flats, which they immediately take up after coming ashore.
Their method of landing is to come collectively to those breeding
grounds where they passed the prior season; but I am not able to
say authoritatively, nor do I believe it, strongly as it has been urged
by many careful men who were with me on the islands, that these
animals come back to and take up the same position on their breeding
grounds that they individually occupied when there last year.
From my knowledge of their action and habit, and from what I
have learned of the natives, I should say that very few, if any, of
them make such a selection and keep these places year after year.
Even did the seal itself intend to come directly from the sea to that
spot on the rookery which it left last summer, what could it do if
it came to that rookery margin a little later and found that another
“see-catch” had occupied its ground? The bull could do nothing.
It would either have to die in its tracks, if it persisted in attaining
this supposed objective point, or do what undoubtedly it does do—seek
the next best locality which it can secure adjacent.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">A Life Study of an aged Fur Seal-Bull or “See-catch.”—Gorbatch Rookery, July 2, 1872</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One aged “see-catch” was pointed out to me at the “Gorbatch”
section of the Reef rookery, as an animal that was long
known to the natives as a regular visitor, close by or on the same
rock, every season during the past three years. They called him
“Old John,” and they said they knew him because he had one of
his posterior digits missing, bitten off, perhaps, in a combat. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>saw him in 1872, and made careful drawings of him in order that
I might recognize his individuality, should he appear again in the
following year, and when that time rolled by, I found him not; he
failed to reappear, and the natives acquiesced in his absence. Of
course it was impossible to say that he was dead when there were
ten thousand rousing, fighting bulls to the right, left, and below
us, under our eyes, for we could not approach for inspection. Still,
if these animals came each to a certain place in any general fashion,
or as a rule, I think there would be no difficulty in recognizing
the fact; the natives certainly would do so; as it is, they do not
I think it very likely, however, that the older bulls come back to
the same common rookery ground where they spent the previous
season; but they are obliged to take up their position on it just as
the circumstances attending their arrival will permit, such as finding
other seals which have arrived before them, or of being whipped
out by stronger rivals from their old stands.</p>

<p>It is entertaining to note, in this connection, that the Russians
themselves, with the object of testing that mooted query, during
the later years of their possession of the islands, drove up a number
of young males from Lukannon, cut off their ears, and turned
them out to sea again. The following season, when the droves
came in from the “hauling-grounds” to the slaughtering-fields,
quite a number of those cropped seals were in the drives, but instead
of being found all at one place—the place from whence they
were driven the year before—they were scattered examples of croppies
from every point on the island. The same experiment was
again made by our people in 1870 (the natives having told them of
such prior undertaking), and they went also to Lukannon, drove up
one hundred young males, cut off their left ears, and set them free
in turn. Of this number, during the summer of 1872, when I was
there, the natives found in their driving of seventy-five thousand
seals from the different hauling-grounds of St. Paul up to the village
killing-grounds, two on Novastoshnah rookery, ten miles north
of Lukannon, and two or three from English Bay and Tolstoi rookeries,
six miles west by water; one or two were taken on St. George
Island, thirty-six miles to the southeast, and not one from Lukannon
was found among those that were driven from there; probably,
had all the young males on the two islands this season been examined,
the rest of the croppies that had returned from the perils of
the deep, whence they sojourned during the winter, would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
been distributed quite equally about the Pribylov hauling-grounds.
Although the natives say that they think the cutting off of the animal’s
ear gives the water such access to its head as to cause its
death, yet I noticed that those examples which we had recognized
by this auricular mutilation, were normally fat and well developed.
Their theory does not appeal to my belief, and it certainly requires
confirmation.</p>

<p>These experiments would tend to prove very cogently and conclusively
that when the seals approach the islands in the spring
they have nothing in their minds but a general instinctive appreciation
of the fitness of the land as a whole, and no special fondness
or determination to select any one particular spot, not even the
place of their birth. A study of my map of the distribution of
the seal-life on St. Paul, clearly indicates that the landing of the
seals on the respective rookeries is influenced greatly by the direction
of the wind at the time of their approach to the islands in the
spring and early summer. The prevailing airs, blowing, as they do
at that season, from the north and northwest, carry far out to sea
the odor of the old rookery flats, together with a fresh scent of
the pioneer bulls which have located themselves on these breeding
grounds three or four weeks in advance of their kind. The seals
come up from the great North Pacific, and hence it will be seen
that the rookeries of the south and southeastern shores of St. Paul
Island receive nearly all the seal-life, although there are miles of
perfectly eligible ground at Nahsayvernia or north shore. To settle
this matter beyond all argument, however, I know is an exceedingly
difficult task, since the identification of individuals, from one season
to another, among the hundreds of thousands, and even millions,
that come under your eye on one of these great rookeries, is well-nigh
impossible. From the time of the first arrival in May up to the
beginning of June, or as late as the middle of that month, if the
weather be clear, is an interval in which everything seems quiet.
Very few seals are added to the pioneers that have landed, as we
have described. About June 1st, however, sometimes a little before,
and never much later, the seal-weather—the foggy, humid, oozy
damp of summer—sets in; and with it, as the gray banks roll up
and shroud the islands, old bull-seals swarm from the depths by
hundreds and thousands, and locate themselves in advantageous
positions for the reception of the females, which are generally three
weeks or a month later than this date in arrival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>It appears from my surrey of these breeding grounds that a
well-understood principle exists among the able-bodied males, to-wit:
that each one shall remain undisturbed on his own ground,
which is usually about six to eight feet square: provided, that at the
start, and from that time until the arrival of the females, he is strong
enough to hold this ground against all comers; inasmuch as the
crowding in of fresh arrivals often causes a removal of those
which, though equally able-bodied at first, have exhausted themselves
by fighting earlier and constantly, they are finally driven by
these fresher animals back farther and higher up on the rookery,
and sometimes off altogether.</p>

<p>The labor of locating and maintaining a position on the rookery
is real, terrible and serious business for these bulls which come in
last, and it is so all the time to those males that occupy the water-line
of the breeding grounds. A constantly sustained fight between
the new-comers and the occupants goes on morning, noon, and night,
without cessation, frequently resulting in death to one, or even both,
of the combatants. The “seecatchie” under six years of age, although
hovering about the sea-margins of the breeding grounds,
do not engage in much fighting there; it is the six and seven year
old males, ambitious and flushed with a full sense of their reproductive
ability, that swarm out and do battle with the older
males of these places. A young male of this latter class is, however,
no match for any fifteen or twenty year old bull, provided
that an old “seecatchie” retains his teeth; for, with these weapons,
his relatively harder thews and sinews give him the advantage in
almost every instance among the hundreds of combats that I have
witnessed. These trials of strength between the old and the young
are incessant until the rookeries are mapped out; since, by common
consent, the males of all classes recognize the coming of the females.
After their arrival and settlement over the whole extent of the
breeding grounds, about July 15th at the latest, very little fighting
takes place.</p>

<p>Many of those bulls exhibit wonderful strength and desperate
courage. I marked one veteran at Gorbatch, who was the first to
take up his position early in May, and that position, as usual,
directly on the water-line. This male seal had fought at least forty
or fifty desperate battles, and beaten off his assailants every time—perhaps
nearly as many different seals each of which had coveted his
position—when the fighting season was over (after the cows are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
mostly all hauled up), I saw him still there, covered with scars and
frightfully gashed—raw, festering, and bloody, one eye gouged out—but
lording it bravely over his harem of fifteen or twenty females,
which were all huddled together around him on the same spot of his
first location.</p>

<p>This fighting between the old and adult males (for none others
fight) is mostly, or rather entirely, done with the mouth. The opponents
seize one another with their teeth, and thus clinching their
jaws, nothing but the sheer strength of the one and the other tugging
to escape can shake them loose; then, that effort invariably
leaves an ugly wound, for the sharp canines tear out deep gutters
in the skin and furrows in the blubber, or shred the flippers into
ribbon-strips.</p>

<p>They usually approach each other with comically averted heads,
just as though they were ashamed of the rumpus which they are determined
to precipitate. When they get near enough to reach one
another, they enter upon the repetition of many feints or passes before
either one or the other takes the initiative by gripping. The
heads are darted out and back as quick as a flash; their hoarse
roaring and shrill, piping whistle never ceases, while their fat
bodies writhe and swell with exertion and rage; furious lights
gleam in their eyes, their hair flies in the air, and their blood
streams down,—all combined makes a picture so fierce and so
strange that, from its unexpected position and its novelty, it is
perhaps one of the most extraordinary brutal contests which a man
can witness.</p>

<p>In these battles of the seals the parties are always distinct; the
one is offensive, the other, defensive. If the latter proves the
weaker, he withdraws from the position occupied, and is never followed
by his conqueror, who complacently throws up one of his
hind flippers, fans himself, as it were, to cool his fevered wrath and
blood from the heat of the conflict, sinks into comparative quiet,
only uttering a peculiar chuckle of satisfaction or contempt, with a
sharp eye open for another covetous bull or “see-catch.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Fur Seals in Deadly Combat: a Thousand such Conflicts are in simultaneous Action during every Minute of the Breeding Season on the
Pribylov Islands</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>That period occupied by the males in taking and holding their
positions on a rookery offers a very favorable opportunity to
study them in the thousand and one different attitudes and postures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>assumed between the two extremes of desperate conflict and deep
sleep—sleep so profound that one can, if he keeps to the leeward,
approach close enough, stepping softly, to pull the whiskers of any
old male taking a nap on a clear place. But after the first touch to
these mustaches the trifler must jump back with electrical celerity,
if he has any regard for the sharp teeth and tremendous shaking
which will surely overtake him if he does not. The younger seals
sleep far more soundly than the old ones, and it is a favorite pastime
for the natives to surprise them in this manner—favorite, because
it is attended with no personal risk. The little beasts, those
amphibious sleepers, rise suddenly, and fairly shrink to the earth,
spitting and coughing out in their terror and confusion.</p>

<p>The neck, chest, and shoulders of a fur-seal bull comprise more
than two-thirds of his whole weight; and in this long, thick neck
and the powerful muscles of the fore-limbs and shoulders is embodied
the larger portion of his strength. When on land, with the
fore-hands he does all climbing over rocks and grassy hummocks
back of the rookery, or shuffles his halting way over smooth
parades—the hind-feet are gathered up as useless trappings after
every second step forward, which we have described at the outset
of this chapter. These anterior flippers are also the propelling
power when in water, and exclusive machinery with which they
drive their rapid passage—the hinder ones float behind like the
steering sweep to a whale-boat, and are used evidently as rudders,
or as the tail of a bird is, while its wings sustain and force its rapid
flight.</p>

<p>The covering to its body is composed of two coats, one being a
short, crisp, glistening over-hair, and the other a close, soft, elastic
pelage or fur, which gives a distinctive value to the pelt. I can
call it readily to the mind of my readers when I say to them that
the down and feathers on the breast of a duck lie relatively as the
fur and hair do upon the skin of the seal.</p>

<p>At this season of first “hauling up”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> in the spring the prevailing
color of the bulls, after they dry off and have been exposed to
the weather, is a dark, dull brown, with a sprinkling in it of lighter
brown-black, and a number of hoary or grizzled gray coats peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
to the very old males. On the shoulders of all of them—that is,
the adults—the over-hair is either a gray or rufous-ochre or a
very emphatic “pepper and salt.” This is called the “wig.” The
body-colors<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> are most intense and pronounced upon the back of
the head, neck, and spine, fading down on the flanks lighter, to
much lighter ground on the abdomen; still never white or even a
clean gray, so beautiful and peculiar to them when young, and to
the females. The skin of the muzzle and flippers is a dark bluish-black,
fading in the older examples to a reddish and purplish tint.
The color of the ears and tail is similar to that of the body, perhaps
a trifle lighter. The ears on a bull fur-seal are from one inch to an
inch and a half in length. The pavilions or auricles are tightly
rolled up on themselves, so that they are similar in shape to and
exactly the size of the little finger on the human hand, cut off at
the second phalangeal joint—a trifle more cone-shaped, however—as
they are greater at the base than they are at the tip. They are
haired and furred as the body is.</p>

<p>I think it probable that this animal is able to and does exert the
power of compressing or dilating this scroll-like pavilion to its ear,
just according as it dives deeper or rises in the water, and also I
am quite sure that the hair-seal has this control over its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">meatus externus</i>,
from what I have seen of it. I have not been able to verify
it in either case by actual observation; yet such opportunity as I
have had gives me undoubted proof of the fact that the hearing of
a fur-seal is wonderfully keen and surpassingly acute. If you
make any noise, no matter how slight, an alarm will be given instantly
by these insignificant-looking auditors, and the animal,
awaking from profound sleep, assumes, with a single motion, an
erect posture, gives a stare of stupid astonishment, at the same time
breaking out into incessant, surly roaring, growling, and “spitting,”
if it be an old male.</p>

<p>This spitting, as I call it, is by no means a fair or full expression
of a most characteristic sound or action, so far as I have observed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
peculiar to fur-seals alone, the bulls in particular. It is
the usual prelude to all their combats, and it is their signal of astonishment.
It follows somewhat in this way: when the two disputants
are nearly within reaching or striking distance, they make
a number of feints or false passes, as fencing-masters do, at one another,
with the mouth wide open, lifting the lips or snarling so as
to exhibit their glistening teeth; with each pass of the head and
neck they expel the air so violently through the larynx as to cause
a rapid <em>choo-choo-choo</em> sound, like steam-puffs as they escape from
the smoke-stack of a locomotive when it starts a heavy train, especially
while the driving-wheels slip on the rail.</p>

<p>All of the bulls have the power and frequent inclination to utter
four distinct calls or notes. This is not the case with the sea-lion,
whose voice is confined to a single bass roar, or that of the walrus,
which is limited to a dull grunt, or that of the hair-seal, which is almost
inaudible. This volubility of the adult male is decidedly characteristic
and prominent. He utters a hoarse, resonant roar, loud and
long; he gives vent to a low, entirely different gurgling growl; he
emits a chuckling, sibilant, piping whistle, of which it is impossible
to convey an adequate idea, for it must be heard to be understood,
and this spitting or <em>choo</em> sound just mentioned. The cow<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
has but one note—a hollow, prolonged, bla-a-ting call, addressed
only to her pup: on all other occasions she is usually silent; it
is something strangely like the cry of a calf or an old sheep.
She also makes a spitting sound or snort when suddenly disturbed—a
kind of cough, as it were. The pups “blaat” also, with little
or no variation, their sound being somewhat weaker and hoarser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
after birth than their mother’s. They, too, comically spit or cough
when aroused suddenly from a nap or driven into a corner, opening
their little mouths (like young birds in a nest) when at bay,
backed up in some crevice or against grassy tussocks.</p>

<p>Indeed, so similar is that call of the female to the bleating of
sheep that a number of the latter, which the Alaska Commercial
Company had brought up from San Francisco to St. George Island
during the summer of 1873, were constantly attracted to the rookeries,
and were running in among the “holluschickie” so much that
they neglected better pasturage on the uplands beyond, and a small
boy had to be regularly employed to herd them where they would
feed to advantage. These transported <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ovidæ</i>, though they could
not possibly find anything in their eyes suggestive of companionship
among the seals, had their ears so charmed by those sheep-like accents
of the female pinnipeds as to persuade them in spite of their
senses of vision and smell.</p>

<p>The sound which arises from these great breeding grounds of
the fur-seal, where thousands upon tens of thousands of angry, vigilant
bulls are roaring, chuckling, and piping, and multitudes of
seal-mothers are calling in hollow, bleating tones to their young,
that in turn respond incessantly, is simple defiance to verbal description.
It is, at a slight distance, softened into a deep booming,
as of a cataract; and I have heard it, with a light, fair wind to
the leeward, as far as six miles out from land on the sea; even
in the thunder of the surf and the roar of heavy gales, it will
rise up and over to your ear for quite a considerable distance away.
It is a monitor which the sea-captains anxiously strain their ears
for, when they run their dead reckoning up, and are lying to for
the fog to rise, in order that they may get their bearings of the
land. Once heard, they hold on to the sound, and feel their way
in to anchor. The seal-roar at “Novastoshnah” during the summer
of 1872 saved the life of a surgeon,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and six natives belonging to
the village, who had pushed out on an egging trip from Northeast
Point to Walrus Island. I have sometimes thought, as I have listened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
all night long to this volume of extraordinary sound, which
never ceases with the rising or the setting of the sun throughout
the entire period of breeding, that it was fully equal to the churning
boom of the waves of Niagara. Night and day, belonging to
that season, vibrates with this steady and constant din upon the
rookeries.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">[<em>Off the Black Bluffs, St. Paul’s Island.</em>]</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The most casual observer will notice that these seals seem to suffer
great inconvenience and positive misery from a comparatively low
degree of heat I have often been surprised to observe that, when
the temperature was 46° and 48° Fahr. on land during the summer,
they would show everywhere signs of distress, whenever they made
any exertion in moving or fighting, evidenced by panting and the elevation
of their hind flippers, which they used incessantly as so many
fans. With the thermometer again higher, as it is at rare intervals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
standing at 55° and 60°, they are then oppressed even when at rest;
and at such times the eye is struck by the kaleidoscopic appearance
of a rookery—in any of these rookeries where the seals are spread
out in every imaginable position their lithesome bodies can assume,
all industriously fan themselves: they use sometimes the fore flippers
as ventilators, as it were, by holding them aloft motionless, at
the same time fanning briskly with the hinder ones, according as
they sit or lie. This wavy motion of fanning or flapping gives a
hazy indistinctness to the whole scene, which is difficult to express
in language; but one of the most prominent characteristics of the
fur-seal, and perhaps the most unique feature, is this very fanning
manner in which they use their flippers, when seen on the breeding
grounds at this season. They also, when idle, as it were, off-shore
at sea, lie on their sides in the water with only a partial exposure
of the body, the head submerged, and then hoist up a fore or hind
flipper clear out of the water, at the same time scratching themselves
or enjoying a momentary nap; but in this position there is
no fanning. I say “scratching,” because the seal, in common with
all animals, is preyed upon by vermin, and it has a peculiar species
of louse, or parasitic tick, which annoys it.</p>

<p>Speaking of seals as they rest in the water leads me to remark
that they seem to sleep as sound and as comfortably, bedded on
the waves or rolled by the swell, as they do on the land. They lie
on their backs, fold the fore flippers down across the chest, and
turn the hind ones up and over, so that the tips rest on their necks
and chins, thus exposing simply the nose and the heels of the hind
flippers above water, nothing else being seen. In this position, unless
it is very rough, the seal sleeps as serenely as did the prototype
of that memorable song, who was “rocked in the cradle of the
deep.”</p>

<p>All the bulls, from the very first, that have been able to hold
their positions, have not left them from the moment of their
landing for a single instant, night or day; nor will they do so
until the end of the rutting season, which subsides entirely between
August 1st and 10th—it begins shortly after the coming of the
cows in June. Of necessity, therefore, this causes them to fast,
to abstain entirely from food of any kind, or water, for three
months at least; and a few of them actually stay out four months,
in total abstinence, before going back into the ocean for the first
time after “hauling up” in May. They then return as so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
bony shadows of what they were only a few months previously;
covered with wounds, abject and spiritless, they laboriously crawl
back to the sea to renew a fresh lease of life.</p>

<p>Such physical endurance is remarkable enough alone; but it is
simply wonderful when we come to associate this fasting with the
unceasing activity, restlessness, and duty devolved upon the bulls
as the heads of large families. They do not stagnate like hibernating
bears in caves; there is not one torpid breath drawn by them
in the whole period of their fast. It is evidently sustained and accomplished
by the self-absorption of their own fat, with which they are
so liberally supplied when they first come out from the sea and take
up their positions on the breeding grounds, and which gradually
disappears, until nothing but the staring hide, protruding tendons
and bones mark the limit of their abstinence. There must be some
remarkable provision made by nature for the entire torpidity of the
seals’ stomachs and bowels, in consequence of their being empty
and unsupplied during this long period, coupled with the intense
activity and physical energy of the animals throughout that time,
which, however, in spite of the violation of a supposed physiological
law, does not seem to affect them, for they come back just as sleek,
fat, and ambitious as ever, in the following season. That the seals
drink or need fresh water, I doubt; but they cool their mouths incessantly
by swimming with them wide open through the waves,
laving as it were their hot throats and lips in the flood.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Between June 12th and 14th, the first of the cow-seals, as a
rule, come up from the sea; then that long agony of the waiting
bulls is over, and they signalize it by a period of universal, spasmodic,
desperate fighting among themselves. Though they have
quarrelled all the time from the moment they first landed, and continue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
to do so until the end of the season, in August, yet that fighting
which takes place at this date is the bloodiest and most vindictive
known to the seal. I presume that the heaviest percentage of
mutilation and death among the old males from these brawls, occur
in this week of the earliest appearance of the females.</p>

<p>A strong contrast now between the males and females looms up,
both in size and shape, which is heightened by an air of exceeding
peace and dove-like amiability which the latter class exhibit, in contradistinction
to the ferocity and saturnine behavior of the former.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
The cows are from four to four and a half feet in length from head
to tail, and much more shapely in their proportions than the bulls;
there is no wrapping around their necks and shoulders of unsightly
masses of blubber; their lithe, elastic forms, from the first to the
last of the season, are never altered; they are, however, enabled to
keep such shape, because, in the provision of seal economy, they
sustain no protracted fasting period; for, soon after the birth of
their young they leave it on the ground and go to the sea for food,
returning perhaps to-morrow, may be later, or even not for several
days in fact, to again suckle and nourish it; having in the meantime
sped far off to distant fishing banks, and satiated a hunger
which so active and highly organized an animal must experience,
when deprived of sustenance for any length of time.</p>

<p>As the females come up wet and dripping from the water, they
are at first a dull, dirty-gray color, dark on the back and upper
parts, but in a few hours the transformation in their appearance
made by drying is wonderful. You would hardly believe that they
could be the same animals, for they now fairly glisten with a rich
steel and maltese gray lustre on the back of the head, the neck, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
along down the spine, which blends into an almost snow-white over
the chest and on the abdomen. But, this beautiful coloring in turn
is again altered by exposure to the same weather; for, after a few
days it will gradually change, so that by the lapse of two or three
weeks it is a dull, rufous-ochre below, and a cinereous brown and
gray mixed above. This color they retain throughout the breeding
season, up to the time of shedding their coats in August.</p>

<p>The head and eye of the female are exceedingly beautiful; the
expression is really attractive, gentle, and intelligent; the large, lustrous,
blue-black eyes are humid and soft with the tenderest expression,
while the small, well-formed head is poised as gracefully on
her neck as can be well imagined; she is the very picture of benignity
and satisfaction, when she is perched up on some convenient
rock, and has an opportunity to quietly fan herself, the eyes half-closed
and the head thrown back on her gently-swelling shoulders.</p>

<p>The females land on these islands, not from the slightest desire
to see their uncouth lords and masters, but from an accurate and
instinctive appreciation of the time in which their period of gestation
ends. They are in fact driven up to the rookeries by this
cause alone; the young cannot be brought forth in the water, and, in
all cases marked by myself, the pups were born soon after landing,
some in a few hours, but, most usually, a day or so elapses before
delivery. They are noticed and received by the males at the
water-line stations with attention; they are alternately coaxed and
urged up on to the rocks, as far as these beach-masters can do
so, by chuckling, whistling, and roaring, and then they are immediately
under the most jealous supervision; but, owing to the
covetous and ambitious nature of those bulls which occupy these
stations to the rear of the water-line and away back, the little cows
have a rough-and-tumble time of it, when they begin to arrive in
small numbers at first; for no sooner is the pretty animal fairly
established on the station of male number one, who has welcomed
her there, than he, perhaps, sees another one of her style in the
water from whence she has come, and, in obedience to his polygamous
feeling, devotes himself anew to coaxing the later arrival,
by that same winning manner so successful in the first case; then
when bull number two, just back, observes bull number one off
guard, he reaches out with his long strong neck and picks up the
unhappy but passive cow by the scruff of hers, just as a cat does
a kitten, and deposits her upon his seraglio ground; then bulls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
number three and four, and so on, in the vicinity, seeing this high-handed
operation, all assail one another, especially number two,
and for a moment have a tremendous fight, perhaps lasting half
a minute or so, and during this commotion the little cow is generally
moved, or moves, farther back from the water, two or three
stations more, where, when all gets quiet again, she usually remains
in peace. Her last lord and master, not having that exposure to
such diverting temptation as her first, gives her such care that she
not only is unable to leave, did she wish, but no other bull can seize
upon her: this is only a faint and (I fully appreciate it) wholly inadequate
description of the hurly-burly and that method by which
the rookeries are filled up, from first to last, when the females arrive—it
is only one instance of the many trials and tribulations
which both parties on the rookery subject themselves to, before the
harems are filled.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">On St. Paul’s Island, 1872-’76</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Far back, fifteen or twenty “see-catchie” stations deep from
the water-line, and sometimes more, but generally not over an
average of ten or fifteen, the cows crowd in at the close of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>season for arriving, which is by July 10th or 14th; then they
are able to go about very much as they please, for the bulls have
become so greatly enfeebled by this constant fasting, fighting, and
excitement during the past two months, that they are quite content
now with only one or two partners, even if they should have no more.</p>

<p>The cows seem to haul up in compact bodies from the
water, covering in the whole ground to the rear of the rookeries,
never scattering about over the surface of this area; they have
mapped out, from the first, their chosen resting-places, and they will
not lie quietly in any position outside of the great mass of their
kind. This is due to their intensely gregarious nature, and is especially
adapted for their protection. And here I should call attention
to the fact that they select this rookery ground with all the skill of
civil engineers. It is preferred with special reference to drainage,
for it must slope so that the produce of constantly dissolving
fogs and rain-clouds shall not lie upon it, since they have a great
aversion to, and a firm determination not to rest on water-puddled
ground. This is admirably exhibited, and will be understood by a
study of my sketch-maps which follow, illustrative of these rookeries
and the area and position of the seals upon them. Every one
of those breeding grounds rises up gently from the sea, and on
no one of them is there anything like a muddy flat.</p>

<p>I found it an exceedingly difficult matter to satisfy myself as to
a fair general average number of cows to each bull on the rookery,
but, after protracted study, I think it will be nearly correct when
I assign to each male a specific ratio of from fifteen to twenty
females at the stations nearest the water, and for those back, in
order, from that line to the rear, from five to twelve; but there are
many exceptional cases, and many instances where forty-five and
fifty females are all under the charge of one male: and then, again,
where there are only two or three females: hence this question was
and is not entirely satisfactory in its settlement to my mind.</p>

<p>Near Ketavie Point, and just above it to the north, is an odd
wash-out of basalt by the surf, which has chiselled, as it were,
from the foundation of the island, a lava table, with a single roadway
or land passage to it. Upon the summit of this footstool I
counted forty-five cows, all under the charge of one old veteran.
He had them penned on this table-rock by taking his stand at
the gate, as it were, through which they passed up and passed
down—a Turkish brute typified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>At the rear of all these rookeries there is invariably a large
number of able-bodied males which have come late, and wait
patiently, yet in vain, for families; most of them having had to
fight as desperately for the privilege of being there as any of their
more fortunately located neighbors, who are nearer the water, and
in succession from there to where they are themselves; but the
cows do not like to be in any outside position. They cannot be
coaxed out where they are not in close company with their female
mates and masses. They lie most quietly and contentedly in the
largest harems, and cover the surface of the ground so thickly
that there is hardly moving or turning room when they cease to
come from the sea. The inaction on the part of those males in the
rear during the breeding season only serves to well qualify them for
moving into the places which are necessarily vacated by disabled
males that are, in the meantime, obliged to leave from virile exhaustion,
or incipient wounds. All the surplus able-bodied bulls, which
have not been successful in effecting a landing on the rookeries cannot
be seen at any one time, however, in the season, on this rear line.
Only a portion of their number are in sight; the others are either
loafing at sea, adjacent, or are hauled out in morose squads between
the rookeries on the beaches. The cows, during the whole season,
do great credit to their amiable expression by their manner and
behavior on the rookery. They never fight or quarrel one with
another, and never or seldom utter a cry of pain or rage when they
are roughly handled by the bulls, which frequently get a cow between
them and actually tear the skin from her back with their
teeth, cutting deep gashes in it as they snatch her from mouth to
mouth. If sand does not get into these wounds it is surprising how
rapidly they heal; and, from the fact that I never could see scars
on them anywhere except the fresh ones of this year, they must
heal effectually and exhibit no trace the next season.</p>

<p>The cows, like the bulls, vary much in weight, but the extraordinary
disparity in the adult size of the sexes is exceedingly
striking. Two females taken from the rookery nearest to St. Paul
village, right under the bluffs (and almost beneath the eaves of the
natives’ houses) called “Nah Speel,” after they had brought forth
their young, were weighed by myself, and their respective returns
on the scales were fifty-six and one hundred pounds each; the
former being about three or four years old, and the latter over six—perhaps
ten. Both were fat, or rather, in good condition—as good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
as they ever are. Thus the female is just about one-sixth the size
of the male. Among the sea-lions the proportion is just one-half
the bulk of the male, while the hair-seals, as I have before stated,
are not distinguishable in this respect, as far as I could observe,
but my notice was limited to a few specimens only.</p>

<p>The courage with which the fur-seal holds his position as the
head and guardian of a family is of the highest order. I have repeatedly
tried to drive them from their harem-posts, when they
were fairly established on their stations, and have, with very few
exceptions, failed. I might use every stone at my command,
making all the noise I could. Finally, to put this courage to its
fullest test, I have walked up to within twenty feet of an old
veteran, toward the extreme end of Tolstoi, who had only four cows
in charge, and commenced with my double-barrelled fowling-piece
to pepper him all over with fine mustard-seed shot, being kind
enough, in spite of my zeal, not to put out his eyes. His bearing,
in spite of the noise, smell of powder, and painful irritation which
the fine shot must have produced, did not change in the least from
the usual attitude of determined, plucky defence (which nearly all
of the bulls assume) when he was attacked with showers of stones and
noise. He would dart out right and left with his long neck and
catch the timid cows that furtively attempted to run after each report
of my gun, fling and drag them back to their places under his
head; and then, stretching up to his full height, look me directly
and defiantly in the face, roaring and chuckling most vehemently.
The cows, however, soon got away from him: they could not
endure my racket, in spite of their dread of him. But he still
stood his ground, making little charges on me of ten or fifteen
feet in a succession of gallops or lunges, spitting furiously, and
then comically retreating, with an indescribable leer and swagger,
to the old position, back of which he would not go, fully resolved to
hold his own or die in the attempt.</p>

<p>This courage is all the more noteworthy from the fact that, in
regard to man, it is invariably of a defensive character. The seal is
always on the defensive; he never retreats, and he will not assail.
If he makes you return when you attack him he never follows you
much farther than the boundary of his station, and then no aggravation
will compel him to take the offensive, so far as I have been
able to observe. I was very much impressed by this trait.</p>

<p>It is quite beyond my power—indeed, entirely out of the question—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
give a fair idea of the thousand and one positions in which
seals compose themselves and rest when on land. They may be said
to assume every possible attitude which a flexible body can be put
into, no matter how characteristic or seemingly forced or constrained.
Their joints seem to be double-hinged—in fact, fitted with
ball and socket union of the bones. One favorite position, especially
with the females, is to perch upon a point or edge-top of some
rock, and throw their heads back upon their shoulders, with the
nose held directly up and aloft; and then, closing their eyes, take
short naps without changing their attitude, now and then softly
lifting one or the other of their long, slender hind flippers, which
they slowly wave with that peculiar fanning motion to which I have
alluded heretofore. Another attitude, and one of the most common,
is to curl themselves up just as a dog does on a hearth-rug,
bringing the tail and nose close together. They also stretch out,
laying the head close to the body, and sleep an hour or two without
rising, holding one of the hind flippers up all the time, now and
then gently moving it, the eyes being tightly closed.</p>

<p>I ought, perhaps, to define the anomalous tail of the fur-seal
here. It is just about as important as the caudal appendage to a
bear; even less significant. It is the very emphasis of abbreviation.
In the old males it is positively only four or five inches in length,
while among the females only two and a half to three inches,
wholly inconspicuous, and not even recognized by the casual
observer: they never wag or move it at all.</p>

<p>I come now to speak of another feature which interested me
nearly, if not quite, as much as any other characteristic of this
creature, and that is their fashion of slumber. The sleep of the
fur-seal, seen on land, from the old male down to the youngest, is
always accompanied by an involuntary, nervous, muscular twitching
and slight shifting of the flippers, together with ever and anon
quivering and uneasy rollings of the body, accompanied by a quick
folding anew of the fore flippers; all of which may be signs, as it
were, in fact, of their simply having nightmares, or of sporting, in
a visionary way, far off in some dreamland sea. But, it may be
that as an old nurse said in reference to the smiles on a sleeping
child’s face, they are disturbed by their intestinal parasites. I have
studied hundreds of such somnolent examples. Stealing softly up
so closely that I could lay my hand upon them from the point
where I was sitting, did I wish to, and watching the sleeping seals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
I have always found their sleep to be of this nervous description.
The respiration is short and rapid, but with no breathing (unless
the ear is brought very close). The quivering, heaving of the
flanks only indicates the action of the lungs. I have frequently
thought that I had succeeded in finding a snoring seal, especially
among the pups; but a close examination always gave some abnormal
reason for it—generally a slight distemper; never anything
more severe, however, than some trifle by which the nostrils were
stopped to a greater or less degree.</p>

<p>The cows on the rookeries sleep a great deal, but the bulls
have the veriest cat-naps that can be imagined. I never could time
the slumber of any old male on the breeding grounds which lasted,
without interruption, longer than five minutes, day or night. While
away from these places, however, I have known them to lie sleeping
in the manner I have described, broken by such fitful, nervous,
dreamy starts, yet without opening the eyes, for an hour or so at a
time.</p>

<p>With an exception of the pups, the fur-seal seems to have very
little rest, awake or sleeping. Perpetual motion is well-nigh incarnate
with its being. I naturally enough, when beginning my
investigation of these seal-rookeries, expected to find the animals
subdued at night, or early morning, on those breeding grounds; but
a few consecutive nocturnal watches satisfied me that the family organization
and noise was as active at one time as at another,
throughout the whole twenty-four hours. If, however, the day
preceding had chanced to be abnormally warm, I never failed then
to find the rookeries much more noisy and active during the night
than they were by daylight. The seals, as a rule, come and go to
and from the sea, fight, roar, and vocalize as much during midnight
moments as they do at noonday times. An aged native endeavored
to satisfy me that the “seecatchie” could see much better
by twilight and night than by daylight. I am not prepared to
prove to the contrary, but I think that the fact of his not being able
to see so well himself at that hour of darkness was a true cause
of most of his belief in the improved nocturnal vision of the seals.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>As I have said before, the females, soon after landing, are delivered
of their young. Immediately after the birth of the pup
(twins are rare, if ever) the little creature finds its voice—a weak,
husky blaat—and begins to paddle about with its eyes wide open
from the start, in a confused sort of way for a few minutes, until
the mother turns round to notice her offspring and give it attention,
and still later, to suckle it; and for this purpose she is supplied
with four small, brown nipples, almost wholly concealed in
the fur, and which are placed about eight inches apart, lengthwise
with the body, on the abdomen, between the fore and hind flippers,
with about four inches of space between them transversely. These
nipples are seldom visible, and then faintly seen through the hair
and fur. The milk is abundant, rich, and creamy. The pups nurse
very heartily, almost gorging themselves; so much so, that they
often have to yield up the excess of what they have taken down,
mewling and puking in a most orthodox manner.</p>

<p>The pup at birth, and for the next three months, is of a jet-black
color, hair and flippers, save a tiny white patch just back of
each forearm. It weighs from three to four pounds, and is twelve
to fourteen inches long. It does not seem to nurse more than once
every two or three days; but in this I am very likely mistaken, for
it may have received attention from its mother in the night, or
other times in the day when I was unable to keep up my watch
over the individual which I had marked for this supervision.</p>

<p>The apathy with which the young are treated by the old on the
breeding grounds, especially by the mothers, was very strange to
me, and I was considerably surprised at it. I have never seen a seal-mother
caress or fondle her offspring; and should it stray to a short
distance from the harem, I could step to and pick it up, and even
kill it before the mother’s eye, without causing her the slightest
concern, as far as all outward signs and manifestations should indicate.
The same indifference is also exhibited by the male to all
that may take place of this character outside of the boundary of his
seraglio; but the moment the pups are inside the limits of his
harem-ground he is a jealous and a fearless protector, vigilant and
determined. But if the little animals are careless enough to pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
beyond this boundary, then I can go up to them and carry them off
before the eye of the old Turk without receiving from him the
slightest attention in their behalf—a curious guardian, forsooth!</p>

<p>It is surprising to me how few of these young pups get crushed
to death while the ponderous bulls are floundering over them, engaged
in fighting and quarrelling among themselves. I have seen
two bulls dash at each other with all the energy of furious rage,
meeting right in the midst of a small “pod” of forty or fifty pups,
tramp over them with all their crushing weight, and bowling them
out right and left in every direction by the impetus of their movements,
without injuring a single one, as far as I could see. Still,
when we come to consider the fact that, despite the great weight of
the old males, their broad, flat flippers and yielding bodies may
press down heavily on these little fellows without actually breaking
bones or mashing them out of shape, it does seem questionable
whether more than one per cent. of all the pups born each season
on these great rookeries of the Pribylov Islands are destroyed in
this manner on the breeding grounds.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The vitality of a fur-seal is simply astonishing. Its physical
organization passes beyond the fabled nine lives of the cat. As a
slight illustration of its tenure of life, I will mention the fact that
one morning Philip came to me with a pup in his arms, which
had just been born and was still womb-moist, saying that the
mother had been killed at Tolstoi by accident, and he supposed
that I would like to have a “choochil.” I took it up into my laboratory,
and, finding that it could walk about and make a great noise,
I attempted to feed it, with the idea of having a comfortable subject
to my pencil for life-study of the young in varied attitudes
of sleep and motion. It refused everything that I could summon
to its attention as food, and, alternately sleeping and walking in its
clumsy fashion about the floor; it actually lived nine days, spending
the half of every one in floundering over the floor, accompanying
all movements with a persistent, hoarse, blasting cry, and I do not
believe it ever had a single drop of its mother’s milk.</p>

<p>In a pup the head is the only disproportionate feature at birth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
when it is compared with an adult form, the neck being also relatively
shorter and thicker. The eye is large, round, and full; but,
almost a “navy blue” at times, it soon changes into the blue-black
of adolescence.</p>

<p>The females appear to go to and come from the water feeding
and bathing quite frequently after bearing their young and an immediate
subsequent coitus with the male: they usually return to the
spot or its immediate neighborhood, where they leave their pups,
crying out for them and recognizing the individual replies; though
ten thousand around, all together, should blaat at once, they
quickly single out their own and nurse them. It would certainly
be a very unfortunate matter if the mothers could not identify their
young by sound, since these pups get together like a great swarm
of bees, and spread out upon the ground in what the sealers call
“pods,” or clustered groups, while they are young and not very
large; thus, from the middle or end of September until they leave
the islands for the dangers of the great Pacific in the winter, along
by the first of November, they gather in this manner, sleeping and
frolicking by tens of thousands, bunched together at various places
all over the islands contiguous to the breeding grounds, and right
on them. A mother comes up from the sea, whither she has been
to wash, and perhaps to feed, for the last day or two, feeling her
way along to about where she thinks her pup should be—at least,
where she left it last; but perhaps she misses it, and finds instead
a swarm of pups in which it has been incorporated, owing to its
great fondness for society. The mother, without first entering into
a crowd of thousands, calls just as a sheep does for a lamb,
and out of all the din she—if not at first, at the end of a few trials—recognizes
the voice of her offspring, and then advances, striking
out right and left toward the position from which it replies; but if
the pup happens at this time to be asleep, it gives, of course, no
response, even though it were close by. In the event of such silence
the cow, after calling for a time without being answered, curls herself
up and takes a nap or lazily basks, to be usually more successful,
or wholly so, when she calls again.</p>

<p>The pups themselves do not know their own mothers, a fact
which I ascertained by careful observation; but they are so constituted
that they incessantly cry out at short intervals during the
whole time they are awake, and in this way the mother can pick out
from the monotonous blaating of thousands of pups her own, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
she will not permit any other one to suckle her. But the “kotickie”
themselves attempt to nose around every seal-mother that comes in
contact with them. I have repeatedly watched young pups as they
made advances to nurse from another pup’s mother, the result invariably
being that, while the “matkah” would permit her own offspring
to suckle freely, yet when these little strangers touched her
nipples she would either move abruptly away or else turn quickly
down upon her stomach, so that the maternal fountains were inaccessible
to alien and hungry “kotickie.” I have witnessed so
many examples of the females turning pups away to suckle only
some particular other one, that I feel sure I am entirely right in saying
that the seal-mothers know their own young, and that they will
not permit any others except them to nurse. I believe that this
maternal recognition is due chiefly to the mother’s scent and hearing.</p>

<p>Between the end of July and August 5th or 8th of every year
the rookeries are completely changed in appearance. The systematic
and regular disposition of the families or harems over the whole
extent of breeding-ground has disappeared. All that clock-work
order which has heretofore existed seems to be broken up. The
breeding season closed, those bulls which have held their positions
since May 1st leave, most of them thin in flesh and weak, and of
their number a very large proportion do not come out again on
land during the season; but such as are seen at the end of October
and November are in good shape. They have a new coat of
rich, dark, gray-brown hair and fur, with gray or grayish-ochre
“wigs” of longer hair over the shoulders, forming a fresh, strong
contrast to the dull, rusty, brown and umber dress in which they
appeared to us during the summer, and which they had begun to
shed about August 1st, in common with the females and the “holluschickie.”
After these males leave at the end of their season’s
work, and of the rutting for the year, those of them that happen to
return to land in any event do not come back until the end of
September and do not haul up on the rookery grounds again. As
a rule, they prefer to herd altogether, like younger males, upon
the sand-beaches and rocky points close to the water.</p>

<p>The cows and pups, together with those bulls which we have
noticed in waiting at the rear of the rookeries, and which have been
in retirement throughout the whole of the breeding season, now
take possession, in a very disorderly manner, of these rookeries;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
also, a large number of young, three, four, and five year old males
come, which have been prevented by the menacing threats of
stronger bulls from an earlier landing among the females during
the breeding season.</p>

<p>Before the middle of August three-fourths, at least, of the cows
at this date are off in the water, only coming ashore at irregular
intervals to nurse and look after their pups a short time. They
presented to my eye, from the summits of the bluffs round about,
a picture more suggestive of entire comfort and enjoyment than anything
I have ever seen presented by animal life. Here, just out
and beyond the breaking of the rollers, they idly lie on the rocks
or sand-beaches, ever and anon turning over and over, scratching
their backs and sides with their fore and hind flippers. The seals
on the breeding ground appear to get very lousy.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Frequent winds and showers will drive and spatter sand into
their fur and eyes, often making the latter quite sore. This occurs
when they are obliged to leave the rocky rookeries and follow their
pups out over the sand-ridges and flats, to which they always have
a natural aversion. On the hauling-grounds they pack the soil
under their feet so hard and tightly in many places that it holds
water in shallow surface-depressions, just like so many rock-basins.
Out of and into these puddles the pups and the females flounder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
and patter incessantly, until evaporation slowly abates the nuisance
for a time only, inasmuch as the next day, perhaps, brings more rain
and the dirty pools are replenished.</p>

<p>The pups sometimes get so thoroughly plastered in these muddy,
slimy puddles, that the hair falls off in patches, giving them, at
first sight, the appearance of being troubled with scrofula or some
other plague: from my investigations directed to this point, I became
satisfied that they were not permanently injured, though evidently
very much annoyed. With reference to this suggestion as
to sickness or distemper among these seals, I gave the subject direct
and continued attention, and in no one of the rookeries could I
discover a single seal, no matter how old or young, which appeared
to be suffering in the least from any physical disorder other than
that which they themselves had inflicted, one upon the other, by
fighting. The third season, passing directly under my observation,
failed to reward my search with any manifestation of disease among
the seals which congregate in such mighty numbers on those rookeries
of St. Paul and St. George. That remarkable freedom from all
such complaints enjoyed by these animals is noteworthy, and a
most trenchant and penetrating cross-questioning of the natives
also failed to give me any history or evidence of an epidemic in the
past.</p>

<p>The observer will, however, notice every summer, gathered in
melancholy squads of a dozen to one hundred or so (scattered along
the coast where the healthy seals never go), those sick and disabled
bulls which have, in the earlier part of the season, been either internally
injured or dreadfully scarred by the teeth of their opponents
in fighting. Sand is blown by strong wind into their fresh
wounds, causing inflammation and sloughing which very often
finishes the life of a victim. The sailors term these invalid gatherings
“hospitals,” a phrase which, like the most of their homely
expressions, is quite appropriate.</p>

<p>Early in August, usually by the 8th or 10th, I noticed one of
the remarkable movements of the season. I refer to the pup’s first
essay in swimming. Is it not odd—paradoxical—that the young
seal, from the moment of his birth until he is a month or six
weeks old, is utterly unable to swim? If he is seized by the
nape of the neck and pitched out a rod into the water from
shore, his bullet-like head will drop instantly below the surface,
and his attenuated posterior extremities flap impotently on it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
Suffocation is the question of only a few minutes, the stupid little
creature not knowing how to raise his immersed head and gain the
air again. After they have attained the age indicated above, their instinct
drives them down to the margin of the surf, where an alternate
ebbing and flowing of its wash, covers and uncovers the rocky
or sandy beaches. They first smell and then touch the moist pools,
and flounder in the upper wash of the surf, which leaves them as
suddenly high and dry as it immersed them at first. After this
beginning they make slow and clumsy progress in learning the
knack of swimming. For a week or two, when overhead in depth,
they continue to flounder about in the most awkward manner,
thrashing the water as little dogs do with their fore feet, making
no attempt whatever to use the hinder ones. Look at that pup
now, launched out for the first time beyond his depth; see how he
struggles—his mouth wide open, and his eyes fairly popping. He
turns instantly to the beach, ere he has fairly struck out from the
point whence he launched in, and, as the receding swell which at
first carried him off his feet and out, now returning, leaves him
high and dry, for a few minutes he seems so weary that he weakly
crawls up, out beyond its swift returning wash, and coils himself
immediately to take a recuperative nap. He sleeps a few minutes,
perhaps half an hour, then awakes as bright as a dollar, apparently
rested, and at his swimming lesson he goes again. By
repeated and persistent attempts, this young seal gradually becomes
familiar with the water and acquainted with his own power over
that element, which is to be his real home and his whole support.
Once boldly swimming, the pup fairly revels in a new happiness.
He and his brethren have now begun to haul and swarm along the
entire length of St. Paul coast, from Northeast Point down and
around to Zapadnie, lining the alternating sand-beaches and rocky
shingle with their chunky, black forms. How they do delight in it!
They play with a zest, and chatter like our own children in the
kindergartens—swimming in endless evolutions, twisting, turning,
or diving—and when exhausted, drawing their plump, round bodies
up again on the beach. Shaking themselves dry as young dogs
would do, they now either go to sleep on the spot or have a lazy
terrestrial frolic among themselves.</p>

<p>Why an erroneous impression ever got into the mind of any
man as to this matter of a pup’s learning to swim, I confess that I
am wholly unable to imagine. I have not seen any “driving” of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
the young pups into the water by the old ones, in order to teach
them this process, as certain authors have positively affirmed.
There is not the slightest supervision by the mother or father of
the pup, from the first moment of his birth, in this respect, until
he leaves for the North Pacific, full-fledged with amphibious power.
At the close of the breeding season, every year, the pups are
restlessly and constantly shifting back and forth over the rookery
ground of their birth, in large squads, sometimes numbering thousands
upon thousands. In the course of this change of position
they all sooner or later come in contact with the sea; they then
blunder into the water for the first time, in a most awkward, ungainly
manner, and get out as quick as they can; but so far from
showing any fear or dislike of this, their most natural element,
as soon as they rest from their exertion they are immediately ready
for a new trial, and keep at it, provided the sea is not too stormy or
rough. During all this period of self-tuition they seem thoroughly
to enjoy the exercise, in spite of their repeated and inevitable discomfitures
at the beginning.</p>

<p>That “podding” of these young pups in the rear of the great
rookeries of St. Paul, is one of the most striking and interesting
phases of this remarkable exhibition of highly-organized life.
When they first bunch together they are all black, for they have
not begun to shed the natal coat; they shine with an unctuous,
greasy reflection, and grouped in small armies or great regiments
on the sand-dune tracts at Northeast Point, they present a most extraordinary
and fascinating sight. Although the appearance of the
“holluschickie” at English Bay fairly overwhelms the observer with
an impression of its countless multitudes, yet I am free to declare
that at no one point in this evolution of the seal-life, during its reproductive
season, have I been so deeply impressed by a sense of
overwhelming enumeration, as I have when, standing on the summit
of Cross Hill, I looked down to the southward and westward over
a reach of six miles of alternate grass and sand-dune stretches, mirrored
upon which were hundreds of thousands of these little black
pups, spread in sleep and sport within this restricted field of vision.
They appeared as countless as the grains of that sand upon which
they rested!</p>

<p>By September 15th, all the pups born during the year have
become familiar with the water; they have all learned to swim,
and are now nearly all down by the water’s edge, skirting in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
large masses the rocks and beaches hitherto unoccupied by seals of
any class this year. Now they are about five or six times their
original weight, or, in other words, they are thirty to forty pounds
avoirdupois, as plump and fat as butter-balls, and they begin to
take on their second coat, shedding their black pup-hair completely.
This second coat does not vary in color, at this age, between the
sexes. They effect such transformation in dress very slowly, and
cannot, as a rule, be said to have ceased their moulting until the
middle or 20th of October.</p>

<p>That second coat, or sea-going jacket, of the pup, is a uniform,
dense, light gray over-hair, with an under-fur which is slightly grayish
in some, but is, in most cases, of a soft light brown hue. The over-hair
is fine, close and elastic, from two-thirds of an inch to an
inch in length, while the fur is not quite half an inch long. Thus
the coarser hair shingles over and conceals the soft under-wool
completely, giving the color by which, after the second year, the
sex of the animal is recognized. A pronounced difference between
the sexes is not effected, however, by color alone until the third
year of the animal’s life. This over-hair of the pup’s new jacket
on its back, neck, and head, is a dark chinchilla-gray, blending into
stone-white, just tinged with a grayish tint on the abdomen and
chest. The upper lip, upon which the whiskers or mustaches take
root, is covered with hair of a lighter gray than that of the body.
This mustache consists of fifteen or twenty longer or shorter
bristles, from half an inch to three inches in length, some brownish,
horn-colored, and others whitish-gray and translucent, on each side
and back and below the nostrils, leaving the muzzle quite prominent
and hairless. The nasal openings and their surroundings are,
as I have before said when speaking of this feature, hairless and
similar to those of a dog.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>The most attractive feature about the fur-seal pup, and that which
holds this place as it grows on and older, is the eye. That organ is
exceedingly clear, dark, and liquid, with which, for beauty and amiability,
together with real intelligence of expression, those of no
other animal that I have ever seen, or have ever read of, can be
compared; indeed, there are few eyes in the orbits of men and
women which suggest more pleasantly the ancient thought of their
being “windows to the soul.” The lids to that eye are fringed with
long, perfect lashes, and the slightest irritation in the way of dust
or sand, or other foreign substances, seems to cause them exquisite
annoyance, accompanied by immoderate weeping. This involuntary
tearfulness so moved Steller that he ascribed it to the processes of
a mind, and declared that seal-mothers actually “shed tears”!</p>

<p>I do not think a seal’s range of vision on land, or out of the
water, is very great. I have frequently experimented with adult
fur-seals, by allowing them to catch sight of my person, so as to
distinguish it as of foreign character, three and four hundred paces
off, taking the precaution of standing quietly to the leeward when
the wind was blowing strong, and then walking unconcernedly up
to them. I have invariably noticed that they would allow me to approach
quite close before recognizing my strangeness; then, as it
occurred to them, they at once made a lively noise, a medley of
coughing, spitting, snorting, and blaating, and plunged in spasmodic
lopes and shambled to get away from my immediate neighborhood.
As to the pups, they all stupidly stare at the form of a human being
until it is fairly on them, when they also repeat in miniature these
vocal gymnastics and physical efforts of the older ones, to retreat
or withdraw a few rods, sometimes only a few feet, from the spot
upon which you have cornered them, after which they instantly resume
their previous occupation of either sleeping or playing, as
though nothing had happened. Perhaps it is safe to say that the
greatest activity displayed by any one of the five senses of the seal
is evidenced in its power of scent. This faculty is all that can be
desired in the line of alertness. I never failed to awaken an adult
seal from the soundest sleep, when from a half to a quarter of a
mile distant, no matter how softly I proceeded, if I got to the
windward, though they sometimes took alarm when I was a mile
off.</p>

<p>They leave evidences of their being on these great reproductive
fields, chiefly at the rookeries, in the hundreds of dead carcasses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
which mark the last of those animals that had been rendered infirm,
sick, and killed by fighting among themselves in the early
part of the season, or of those which have crawled far away from
the scene of battle to die from death-wounds received in bitter
struggles for a harem. On the rookeries, wherever these lifeless
bodies rest, the living, old and young, clamber and patter backward
and forward over and on the putrid remains: thus such constant
stirring up of decayed matter, gives rise to an exceedingly disagreeable
and far-reaching “funk.” This has been, by all writers who
have dwelt on the subject, referred to as the smell which those animals
emit for another reason—erroneously called the “rutting
odor.” If these creatures have any odor peculiar to them when in
this condition, I will frankly confess that I am unable to distinguish
it from the fumes which are constantly being stirred up and arising
out of those putrescent carcasses so disturbed, as well as from
the bodies of the few pups which have been killed accidentally by
heavy bulls fighting over them, charging back and forth against one
another, so much of the time.</p>

<p>They have, however, a very characteristic and peculiar smell
when they are driven and get heated; their breath-exhalations
possess a disagreeable, faint, sickly odor, and when I have walked
within its influence at the rear of a seal-drive, I could almost fancy,
as it entered my nostrils, that I stood beneath an ailantus-tree in
full bloom; but this odor can by no means be confounded with
what is universally ascribed to another cause. It is also noteworthy
that if your finger is touched ever so lightly to a little fur-seal
blubber, it will smell very much like that which I have appreciated
and described as peculiar to their breath, which arises from them
when they are driven, only it is a little stronger. Both the young
and old fur-seals have this same breath-taint at all seasons of the
year.</p>

<p>With the precision of clock-work and the regularity of the precession
of the seasons, fur-seals have adopted and enforced the
following method of life on these islands of Pribylov. In this system
millions of those highly organized animals sustain themselves.</p>

<p><em>First.</em>—The earliest bulls land in a negligent, indolent way, at
the opening of the season, soon after the rocks at the water’s edge
are free from ice, frozen snow, etc. This is, as a rule, about the
1st to the 5th of every May. They land from the beginning to the
end of the season in perfect confidence and without fear; they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
very fat, and will weigh on an average five hundred pounds each;
some stay at the water’s edge, some go to the tier back of them
again, and so forth, until the whole rookery is mapped out by them,
weeks in advance of the arrival of the first female.</p>

<p><em>Second.</em>—That by the 10th or 12th of June, all the male stations
on the rookeries have been mapped out and fought for, and held in
waiting by the “see-catchie.” These males are, as a rule, bulls
rarely ever under six years of age; most of them are over that age,
being sometimes three, and occasionally doubtless four or five
times as old.</p>

<p><em>Third.</em>—That the cows make their first appearance, as a class,
on or after the 12th or 15th of June, in very small numbers, but
rapidly after the 23d and 25th of this month, every year, they begin
to flock up in such numbers as to fill the harems very perceptibly,
and by the 8th or 10th of July they have all come, as a rule—a few
stragglers excepted. The average weight of the females now will
not be much more than eighty to ninety pounds each.</p>

<p><em>Fourth.</em>—That the breeding season is at its height from the 10th
to the 15th of July every year, and that it subsides entirely at the
end of this month and early in August; also, that its method and
system are confined entirely to the land, never effected in the sea.</p>

<p><em>Fifth.</em>—That the females bear their first young when they are
three years old, and that the period of gestation is nearly twelve
months, lacking a few days only of that lapse of time.</p>

<p><em>Sixth.</em>—That the females bear a single pup each, and that this
is born soon after landing. No exception to this rule as ever been
witnessed or recorded.</p>

<p><em>Seventh.</em>—That the “see-catchie” which have held the harems
from the beginning to the end of the season, leave for the water in
a desultory and straggling manner at its close, greatly emaciated,
and do not return, if they do at all, until six or seven weeks have
elapsed, when the regular systematic distribution of the families
over the rookeries is at an end for this season. A general medley
of young males now are free: they come out of the water, and wander
over all these rookeries, together with many old males, which
have not been on seraglio duty, and great numbers of the females.
An immense majority over all others present are pups, since only
about twenty-five per cent. of the mother-seals are out of the water
now at any one time.</p>

<p><em>Eighth.</em>—That the rookeries lose their compactness and definite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
boundaries of true breeding limit and expansion by the 25th to the
28th of July every year; then, after this date, the pups begin to
haul back, and to the right and left, in small squads at first, but as
the season goes on, by the 18th of August, they depart without reference
to their mothers; and when thus scattered, the males, females
and young swarm over more than three and four times the
area occupied by them when breeding and born on the rookeries.
The system of family arrangement and uniform compactness of the
breeding classes breaks up at this date.</p>

<p><em>Ninth.</em>—That by the 8th or 10th of August the pups born nearest
the water first begin to learn to swim; and that by the 15th or
20th of September they are all familiar, more or less, with the exercise.</p>

<p><em>Tenth.</em>—That by the middle of September the rookeries are entirely
broken up; confused, straggling bands of females are seen
among bachelors, pups, and small squads of old males, crossing and
recrossing the ground in an aimless, listless manner. The season
is now over.</p>

<p><em>Eleventh.</em>—That many of the seals do not leave these grounds of
St. Paul and St. George before the end of December, and some remain
even as late as the 12th of January; but that by the end of
October and the beginning of November every year, all the fur-seals
of mature age—five and six years, and upward—have left the
islands. The younger males go with the others; many of the pups
still range about the islands, but are not hauled to any great extent
on the beaches or the flats. They seem to prefer the rocky shore-margin,
and to lie as high up as they can get on such bluffy rookeries
as Tolstoi and the Reef. By the end of this month, November,
they are, as a rule, all gone.</p>

<p>I now call the attention of the reader to another very remarkable
feature in the economy of the seal-life on these islands. The
great herds of “holluschickie,”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> numbering from one-third to one-half,
perhaps, of the whole aggregate of near five million seals
known to the Pribylov group, are never allowed by the old “seecatchie”
(which threaten frightful mutilation or death) to put
their flippers on or near the rookeries.</p>

<p>By reference to my map, it will be observed that I have located<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
a large extent of ground—markedly so on St Paul—as that occupied
by the seals’ “hauling-ground”; this area, in fact, represents
those portions of the island upon which the “holluschickie” roam
in heavy squadrons, wearing away and polishing the surface of
the soil, stripping every foot, which is indicated on the chart as
such, of its vegetation and mosses, leaving a margin as sharply
defined on those bluffy uplands and sandy flats as it is on the map
itself.</p>

<p>The reason that so much more land is covered by the “holluschickie”
than by the breeding seals—ten times as much at least—is
due to the fact that, though not as numerous, perhaps, as the
breeding seals, yet they are tied down to nothing, so to speak—are
wholly irresponsible, and roam hither and thither as caprice and
the weather may dictate. Thus they wear off and rub down a
much larger area than the rookery seals occupy; wandering aimlessly,
and going back, in some instances, notably at English Bay,
from one-half to a whole mile inland, not travelling in desultory
files along winding, straggling paths, but sweeping in solid platoons,
they obliterate every spear of grass and rub down nearly
every hummock in their restless marching.</p>

<p>All the male seals, under six years of age, are compelled to herd
apart by themselves and away from the breeding grounds, in many
cases far away; the large hauling-grounds at Southwest Point being
about two miles from the nearest rookery. This class of seals
is termed “holluschickie” or the “bachelors” by the people: a
most fitting and expressive appellation.</p>

<p>The seals of this great subdivision are those with which the natives
on the Pribylov group are the most familiar: naturally and
especially so, since they are the only ones, with the exception of a
few thousand pups, and occasionally an old bull or two, taken late
in the fall for food and skins, which are driven up to the killing-grounds
at the village for slaughter. The reasons for this exclusive
attention to the “bachelors” are most cogent, and will be given
hereafter when the “business” is discussed.</p>

<p>Since the “holluschickie” are not permitted by their own kind
to land on the rookeries and stop there, they have the choice of two
methods of locating, one of which allows them to rest in the rear of
the rookeries, and the other on the free beaches. The most notable
illustration of the former can be witnessed on Reef Point, where a
pathway is left for their ingress and egress through a rookery—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
path left by common consent, as it were, between the harems. On
these trails of passage they come and go in steady files all day and
all night during the season, unmolested by the jealous bulls which
guard the seraglios on either side as they travel—all peace and
comfort to the young seal if he minds his business and keeps
straight on up or down, without stopping to nose about right or
left; all woe and destruction to him, however, if he does not, for in
that event he will be literally torn in bloody gripping, from limb to
limb, by vigilant “see-catchie.”</p>

<p>Since the two and three year old “holluschickie” come up in
small squads with the first bulls in the spring, or a few days later,
such common highways as those between the rookery ground and
the sea are travelled over before the arrival of the cows, and get
well defined. A passage for the “bachelors,” which I took much
pleasure in observing day after day at Polavina, another at Tolstoi,
and two on the Reef, in 1872, were entirely closed up by the “sea-catchie”
and obliterated when I again searched for them in 1874.
Similar passages existed, however, on several of the large rookeries
of St. Paul. One of those at Tolstoi exhibits this feature very
finely, for here the hauling-ground extends around from English
Bay, and lies up back of the Tolstoi rookery, over a flat and rolling
summit, from one hundred to one hundred and twenty feet above
the sea-level. The young males and yearlings of both sexes come
through and between the harems at the height of the breeding
season on two of these narrow pathways, and before reaching the
ground above, are obliged to climb up an almost abrupt bluff,
which they do by following and struggling in the water-runs and
washes that are worn into its face. As this is a large hauling-ground,
on which, every favorable day during the season, fifteen
or twenty thousand commonly rest, a view of skilful seal-climbing
can be witnessed here at any time during that period; and the
sight of such climbing as this of Tolstoi is exceedingly novel and
interesting. Why, verily, they ascend over and upon places where
a lively man might, at first thought, say with great positiveness
that it was utterly impossible for him to climb!</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Holluschickie hauling on Lukannon Sands: Myriads come out from the Sea in a single cool foggy night by this manner of progression</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The other method of coming ashore, however, is the one most
followed and favored. In this case they avoid the rookeries altogether,
and repair to unoccupied beaches between them; and
then extend themselves out all the way back from the sea, as far
from the water, in some cases, as a quarter and even half of a mile.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>I stood on the Tolstoi sand-dunes one afternoon, toward the middle
of July, and had under my eyes, in a straightforward sweep from
my feet to Zapadnie, a million and a half of seals spread out on
those hauling-grounds. Of these I estimated that fully one-half, at
that time, were pups, yearlings, and “holluschickie.” The rookeries
across the bay, though plainly in sight, were so crowded that they
looked exactly as I have seen surfaces appear upon which bees had
swarmed in obedience to that din and racket made by the watchful
apiarian when he desires to secure a hive of restless honey-makers.</p>

<p>The great majority of yearlings and “holluschickie” are annually
hauled out, scattered thickly over the sand-beach and upland
hauling-grounds which lie between the rookeries on St. Paul
Island. At St. George there is nothing of this extensive display to
be seen, for here is only a tithe of the seal-life occupying St. Paul,
and no opportunity whatever is afforded for an amphibious parade.</p>

<p>Descend with me from this sand-dune elevation of Tolstoi, and
walk into that drove of “holluschickie” below us. We can do it.
You do not notice much confusion or dismay as we go in among
them. They simply open out before us and close in behind our
tracks, stirring, crowding to the right and left as we go, twelve or
twenty feet away from us on each side. Look at this small flock of
yearlings—some one, others two, and even three years old—which
are coughing and spitting around us now, staring up in our faces
in amazement as we walk ahead. They struggle a few rods out of
our reach, and then come together again behind us, showing no
further sign or notice of ourselves. You could not walk into a
drove of hogs at Chicago without exciting as much confusion and
arousing an infinitely more disagreeable tumult; and as for sheep on
the plains, they would stampede far quicker. Wild animals, indeed!
You can now readily understand how easy it is for two or
three men, early in the morning, to come where we are, turn aside
from this vast herd in front of and around us two or three thousand
of the best examples, and drive them back, up, and over to the village.
That is the way they get the seals. There is no “hunting,”
no “chasing,” no “capturing” of fur-seals on these islands.</p>

<p>While the young male seals undoubtedly have the power of
going for lengthy intervals without food, they, like the female seals
on the breeding grounds, certainly do not maintain any long fasting
periods on land. Their coming and going from the shore is frequent
and irregular, largely influenced by the exact condition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
the weather from day to day. For instance, three or four thick,
foggy days seem to call them out from the water by hundreds of
thousands upon the different hauling-grounds (which the reader
observes recorded on my map). In some cases I have seen them
lie there so close together that scarcely a foot of ground, over whole
acres, is bare enough to be seen. Then a clear and warmer day
follows, and this seal-covered ground, before so thickly packed with
animal life, will soon be almost deserted—comparatively so, at
least—to be filled up immediately as before, when favorable weather
shall again recur. They must frequently eat when here, because
the first yearlings and “holluschickie” that appear in the spring
are no fatter, sleeker, or livelier than they are at the close of the
season. In other words, their condition, physically, seems to be
the same from the beginning to the end of their appearance here
during the summer and fall. It is quite different, however, with
the “see-catch.” We know how and where it spends two to three
months, because we find it on the ground at all times, day or
night, during that period.</p>

<p>A small flock of the young seals, one to three years old generally,
will often stray from these hauling-ground margins up and
beyond over the fresh mosses and grasses, and there sport and play
one with another just as little puppy-dogs do: but, when weary of
this gambolling, a general disposition to sleep is suddenly manifested,
and they stretch themselves out and curl up in all the positions
and all the postures that their flexible spines and ball-and-socket
joints will permit. They seem to revel in the unwonted
vegetation, and to be delighted with their own efforts in rolling
down and crushing the tall stalks of grasses and umbelliferous
plants. One will lie upon its back, hold up its hind flippers, and
lazily wave them about, while it scratches, or rather rubs, its ribs
with the fore-hands alternately, the eyes being tightly closed during
the whole performance. The sensation is evidently so luxurious
that it does not wish to have any side-issue draw off its blissful
self-attention. Another, curled up like a cat on a rug, draws its
breath, as indicated by the heaving of its flanks, quickly, but regularly,
as though in heavy sleep. Another will lie flat upon its
stomach, its hind flippers covered and concealed, while it tightly
folds its fore-feet back against its sides, just as a fish carries its
pectoral fins, and so on to no end of variety, according to the ground
and the fancy of the animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>

<p>These “bachelor” seals are, I am sure, without exception, the
most restless animals, in the whole brute creation, which can boast
of a high organization. They frolic and lope about over the grounds
for hours without a moment’s cessation, and their sleep after this is
exceedingly short, and it is ever accompanied by nervous twitchings
and uneasy muscular movements. They seem to be fairly
brimful and overrunning with spontaneity, to be surcharged with
fervid, electric life.</p>

<p>Another marked feature observed among the multitudes of
“holluschickie” which have come under my personal observation
and auditory, and one very characteristic of this class, is that
nothing like ill-humor appears in all of their playing together.
They never growl or bite or show even the slightest angry feeling,
but are invariably as happy, one with another, as can be imagined.
This is a very singular trait. They lose it, however, with astonishing
rapidity when their ambition and strength develops and carries
them in due course of time to the rookery.</p>

<p>The pups and yearlings have an especial fondness for sporting
on rocks which are just at the water’s level and awash, so as to be
covered and uncovered as the surf rolls in. On the bare summit of
these wave-worn spots they will struggle and clamber, in groups of
a dozen or two at a time, throughout the whole day in endeavoring
to push off that one of their number which has just been fortunate
enough to secure a landing. The successor has, however, but a
brief moment of exultation in victory, for the next roller that comes
booming in, together with that pressure by its friends, turns the table,
and the game is repeated, with another seal on top. Sometimes, as
well as I could see, the same squad of “holluschickie” played for an
entire day and night, without a moment’s cessation, around such a
rock as this off “Nah Speel” rookery; still, in this observation I
may be mistaken, because those seals could not be told apart.</p>

<p>That graceful unconcern with which fur-seals sport safely in,
among, and under booming breakers, during the prevalence of
numerous wild gales at the islands, has afforded me many consecutive
hours of spell-bound attention to them, absorbed in watching
their adroit evolutions within the foaming surf, that seemingly every
moment would, in its fierce convulsions, dash these hardy swimmers,
stunned and lifeless, against those iron-bound foundations
of the shore which alone checked the furious rush of the waves.
Not at all. Through the wildest and most ungovernable mood of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
a roaring tempest and storm-tossed waters attending its transit I
never failed, on creeping out and peering over the bluffs in such
weather, to see squads of these perfect watermen, the most expert
of all amphibians, gambolling in the seething, creamy wake of
mighty rollers which constantly broke in thunder-tones over their
alert, dodging heads. The swift succeeding waves seemed every
instant to poise those seals at the very verge of death; yet the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Callorhinus</i>, exulting in his skill and strength, bade defiance to
their wrath and continued his diversions.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">[<em>Characteristic pelagic attitude of the “holluschickie.”</em>]</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The “holluschickie” are the champion swimmers of all the seal
tribe; at least, when in the water around the islands, they do nearly
every fancy tumble and turn that can be executed. The grave old
males and their matronly companions seldom indulge in any extravagant
display, as do these youngsters, which jump out of the water
like so many dolphins, describing beautiful elliptic curves sheer
above its surface, rising three and even four feet from the sea, with
the back slightly arched, the fore flippers folded tightly against the
sides, and the hinder ones extended and pressed together straight
out behind, plumping in head first, to reappear in the same manner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
after an interval of a few seconds of submarine swimming, swift
as the flight of a bird on its course. Sea-lions and hair-seals never
leap in this manner.</p>

<p>All classes will invariably make these dolphin-jumps when they
are surprised or are driven into the water, curiously turning their
heads while sailing in the air, between the “rises” and “plumps,”
to take a look at the cause of their disturbance. They all swim
rapidly, with the exception of the pups, and may be said to dart
under the water with the velocity of a bird on the wing. As they
swim they are invariably submerged, running along horizontally
about two or three feet below the surface, guiding their course with
the hind flippers, as by an oar, and propelling themselves solely by
the fore feet, rising to breathe at intervals which are either very
frequent or else so wide apart that it is impossible to see the speeding
animal when he rises a second time.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>How long they can remain under water without taking a fresh
breath is a problem which I had not the heart to solve, by instituting
a series of experiments at the island; but I am inclined to
think that, if the truth were known in regard to their ability of
going without rising to breathe, it would be considered astounding.
On this point, however, I have no data worth discussing, but will
say that in all their swimming which I have had a chance to study,
as they passed under the water, mirrored to my eyes from the bluff
above by the whitish-colored rocks below the rookery waters at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
Great Eastern rookery, I have not been able to satisfy myself how
they used their long, flexible hind-feet, other than as steering media.
If these posterior members have any perceptible motion, it is so rapid
that my eye is not quick enough to catch it; but the fore flippers,
however, can be most distinctly seen as they work in feathering forward
and sweeping flatly back, opposed to the water, with great rapidity
and energy. They are evidently the sole propulsive power
of the fur-seal in the water, as they are its main fulcrum and lever
combined for progression on land. I regret that the shy nature of
the hair-seal never allowed me to study its swimming motions, but
it seems to be a general point of agreement among authorities on
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phocidæ</i>, that all motion in water by them arises from that power
which they exert and apply with the hind-feet. So far as my observations
on the hair-seal go, I am inclined to agree with this opinion.</p>

<p>All their movements in water, no matter whether travelling to
some objective point or merely in sport, are quick and joyous, and
nothing is more suggestive of intense satisfaction and pure physical
comfort than is that spectacle which we can see every August
a short distance at sea from any rookery, where thousands of
old males and females are idly rolling over in the billows side by
side, rubbing and scratching with their fore and hind flippers,
which are here and there stuck up out of the water by their owners,
like so many lateen-sails of Mediterranean feluccas, or, when
their hind flippers are presented, like a “cat-o’-nine tails.” They
sleep in the water a great deal, too, more than is generally supposed,
showing that they do not come ashore to rest—very clearly not.</p>

<p>How fast the fur-seal can swim, when doing its best, I am
naturally unable to state. I do know that a squad of young “holluschickie”
followed the <em>Reliance</em>, in which I was sailing, down
from the latitude of the Seal Islands to Akootan Pass with perfect
ease; playing around the vessel while she was logging, straight
ahead, fourteen knots to the hour.</p>

<p>When the “holluschickie” are up on land they can be readily
separated into their several classes, as to age, by the color of their
coats and size, when noted: thus, as yearlings, two, three, four,
and five years old males. When the yearlings, or the first class,
haul out, they are dressed just as they were after they shed their
pup-coats and took on the second covering, during the previous
year in September and October; and now, as they come out in
the spring and summer, one year old, the males and females cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
be distinguished apart, either by color or size, shape or action;
the yearlings of both sexes have the same steel-gray backs and
white stomachs, and are alike in behavior and weight.</p>

<p>Next year those yearling females, which are now trooping out
with these youthful males on the hauling-grounds, will repair to
the rookeries, but their male companions will be obliged to return
alone to this same spot.</p>

<p>About the 15th and 20th of every August they have become
perceptibly “stagey,” or, in other words, their hair is well under
way in shedding. All classes, with the exception of the pups, go
through this renewal at this time every year. The process requires
about six weeks between the first dropping or falling out of the old
over-hair and its full substitution by the new: this change takes
place, as a rule, between August 1st and September 28th.</p>

<p>The fur is shed, but it is so shed that the ability of a seal to
take to the water and stay there, and not be physically chilled or
disturbed during its period of moulting, is never impaired. The
whole surface of these extensive breeding-grounds, traversed over
by me after the seals had gone, was literally matted with shedded
hair and fur. This under-fur or pelage is, however, so fine and
delicate, and so much concealed and shaded by the coarser over-hair,
that a careless eye or a superficial observer might be pardoned
in failing to notice the fact of its dropping and renewal.</p>

<p>The yearling cows retain the colors of the old coat in the new,
when they shed for the first time, and so repeat them from that
time on, year after year, as they live and grow old. The young
three-year-olds and the mature cows look exactly alike, as far as
color goes, when they haul up at first and dry out on the rookeries,
every June and July.</p>

<p>The yearling males, however, make a radical change when they
shed for the first time, since they come out from their “staginess”
in a nearly uniform dark gray, and gray and black mixed, and
lighter, with dark ochre to whitish on the upper and under parts,
respectively. This coat, next year, when they appear as two-year-olds,
shedding for the three-year-old coat, is a very much darker
gray, and so on to the third, fourth, and fifth seasons; then after
this, with age, they begin to grow more gray and brown, with
a rufous-ochre and whitish-tipped “wig” on the shoulders. Some
of the very old bulls change in their declining years to a uniform
shade, all over, of dull-grayish ochre. The full glory and beauty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
the seal’s mustache is denied to him until he has attained his seventh
or eighth year.</p>

<p>The male does not get his full growth and weight until the
close of his seventh year, but realizes most of it, osteologically
speaking, by the end of the fifth; and from this it may be perhaps
truly inferred that the male seals live to an average age of eighteen
or twenty years, if undisturbed in a normal condition, and that the
females exist ten or twelve seasons under the same favorable circumstances.
Their respective weights, when fully mature and fat,
in the spring, will, in regard to the male, strike an average of from
four to five hundred pounds, while the females will show a mean of
from seventy to eighty pounds.</p>

<p>The female does not gain a maximum size and weight until the
end of her fourth year, so far as I have observed, but she does most
of her longitudinal growing in the first two. After she has passed
her fourth and fifth years, she weighs from thirty to fifty pounds
more than she did in the days of her youthful maternity.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
table of these weights given below it will be observed that the adult
females correspond with the three years old males; also, that the
younger cows weigh frequently only seventy-five pounds, and many
of the older ones go as high as one hundred and twenty, but an average
of eighty to eighty-five pounds is the rule. Those specimens
just noted which I weighed were examples taken by me for transmission
to the Smithsonian Institution, otherwise I should not
have been permitted to make this record of their bulk, inasmuch
as weighing them means to kill them; and the law and the habit,
or rather the prejudice of the entire community up there, is unanimously
in opposition to any such proceeding, for they never touch
females, and never go near or disturb the breeding-grounds on
such an errand. It will be noticed, also, that I have no statement
of the weights of any exceedingly fat and heavy males which appear
first on the breeding grounds in the spring; those which I have
referred to, in the table above given, were very much heavier at the
time of their first appearance, in May and June, than at the moment
when they were in my hands, in July; but the cows, and the other
classes, do not sustain protracted fasting, and therefore their avoirdupois
may be considered substantially the same throughout the year.</p>

<p>Thus, from the fact that all the young seals and females do not
vary much in weight from the time of their first coming out in
the spring, till that of their leaving in the fall and early winter, I
feel safe in saying that they feed at irregular but not long intervals,
during this period when they are here under our observation, since
they are constantly changing from land to water and from water to
land, day in and day out. I do not think that the young males fast
longer than a week or ten days at a time, as a rule.</p>

<p>By the end of October and November 10th, a great mass of
the “holluschickie,” the trooping myriads of English Bay, Southwest
Point, Reef Parade, Lukannon Sands, the table-lands of Polavina,
and the mighty hosts of Novastoshnah, at St. Paul, together
with the quota of St. George, had taken their departure from these
shores, and had gone out to sea, feeding upon the receding
schools of fish that were now retiring to the deeper waters of the
North Pacific, where, in that vast expanse, over which rolls an unbroken
billow, five thousand miles from Japan to Oregon, they
spend the winter and the early spring, until they reappear and
break up, with their exuberant life, the dreary winter-isolation of
the land which gave them birth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>A few stragglers remain, however, as late as the snow and ice
will permit them to, in and after December; then they are down
by the water’s edge, and haul up entirely on the rocky beaches,
deserting the sand altogether; but the first snow that falls in October
makes them very uneasy, and a large hauling-ground will be
so disturbed by a rainy day and night that its hundreds of thousands
of occupants fairly deserted it. The fur-seal cannot bear,
and will not endure, the spattering of sand into its eyes, which
usually accompanies the driving of a rain-storm; they take to the
water, to reappear, however, when that nuisance shall be abated.</p>

<p>The weather in which the fur-seal delights is cool, moist, foggy,
and thick enough to keep the sun always obscured, so as to cast no
shadows. Such weather, which is the normal weather of St. Paul
and St. George, continued for a few weeks in June and July, brings
up from the sea millions of fur-seals. But, as I have before said, a
little sunshine, which raises the temperature as high as 50° to 55°
Fahr., will send them back from the hauling-grounds almost as
quickly as they came. Fortunately, these warm, sunny days on the
Pribylov Islands are so rare that the seals certainly can have no
ground of complaint, even if we may presume they have any at all.
Some curious facts in regard to their selection of certain localities
on these islands, and their abandonment of others, are now on record.</p>

<p>I looked everywhere and constantly, when threading my way
over acres of ground which were fairly covered with seal-pups and
older ones, for specimens that presented some abnormity, <em>i.e.</em>, monstrosities,
albinos, and the like, such as I have seen in our great
herds of stock; but I was, with one or two exceptions, unable to
note anything of the kind. I have never seen any malformations or
“monsters” among the pups and other classes of the fur-seals, nor
have the natives recorded anything of the kind, so far as I could ascertain
from them. I saw only three albino pups among the multitudes
on St. Paul, and none on St. George. They did not differ, in
any respect, from the normal pups in size and shape. Their hair,
for the first coat, was a dull ochre all over; the fur whitish, changing
to a rich brown, the normal hue; the flippers and muzzle were a
pinkish flesh-tone in color, and the iris of the eye sky-blue. After
they shed, during the following year, they have a dirty, yellowish-white
color, which makes them exceedingly conspicuous when
mixed in among a vast majority of black pups, gray yearlings, and
“holluschickie” of their kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>Undoubtedly some abnormal birth-shapes must make their appearance
occasionally; but at no time while I was there, searching
keenly for any such manifestation of malformation on the rookeries,
did I see a single example. The morphological symmetry of the
fur-seal is one of the most salient of its characteristics, viewed as it
rallies here in such vast numbers; but the osteological differentiation
and asymmetry of this animal is equally surprising.</p>

<p>It is perfectly plain that a large percentage of this immense
number of seals must die every year from natural limitation of life.
They do not die on these islands; that much I am certain of. Not
one dying a natural death could I find or hear of on the grounds.
They evidently lose their lives at sea, preferring to sink with the
<em>rigor mortis</em> into that cold, blue depth of the great Pacific, or beneath
the green waves of Bering Sea, rather than to encumber and
disfigure their summer haunts on the Pribylov Islands.</p>

<p>Prior to the year 1835, no native on the islands seemed to have
any direct knowledge, or was even acquainted with a legendary tradition,
in relation to the seals, concerning their area and distribution
on the land here; but they all chimed in after that date with great
unanimity, saying that the winter preceding this season (1835-36)
was one of frightful severity; that many of their ancestors who had
lived on these islands in large barraboras just back of the Black
Bluffs, near the present village, and at Polavina, then perished
miserably.</p>

<p>They say that the cold continued far into the summer; that immense
masses of clearer and stronger ice-floes than had ever been
known to the waters about the islands, or were ever seen since,
were brought down and shoved high up on to all the rookery margins,
forming an icy wall completely around the island, and loomed
twenty to thirty feet above the surf. They further state that this
frigid cordon did not melt or in any way disappear until the middle
or end of August, 1836.</p>

<p>They affirm that for this reason the fur-seals, when they attempted
to land, according to their habit and their necessity,
during June and July, were unable to do so in any considerable
numbers. The females were compelled to bring forth their young
in the water and at the wet, storm-beaten surf-margins, which
caused multitudes of mothers and all of the young to perish. In
short, the result was a virtual annihilation of the breeding-seals.
Hence, at the following season, only a spectral, a shadowy imitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
of former multitudes could be observed upon the seal-grounds of
St. Paul and St. George.</p>

<p>On the Lagoon rookery, now opposite the village of St. Paul,
there were then only two males, with a number of cows. At Nah
Speel, close by and right under the village, there were then only
some two thousand. This the natives know, because they counted
them. On Zapadnie there were about one thousand cows, bulls,
and pups; at Southwest Point there were none. Two small rookeries
were then on the north shore of St. Paul, near a place called
“Maroonitch;” and there were seven small rookeries running
round Northeast Point, but on all of these there were only fifteen
hundred males, females, and young; and this number includes the
“holluschickie,” which, in those days, lay in among the breeding-seals,
there being so few old males that they were gladly permitted
to do so. On Polavina there were then about five hundred cows,
bulls, pups, and “holluschickie;” on Lukannon and Keetavie,
about three hundred; but on Keetavie there were only ten bulls
and so few young males lying in altogether that these old natives, as
they told me, took no note of them on the rookeries just cited.
On the Reef, and Gorbatch, were about one thousand only. In this
number last mentioned some eight hundred “holluschickie” may
be included, which laid with the breeding-seals. There were only
twenty bulls on Gorbatch, and about ten old males on the Reef.</p>

<p>Such, briefly and succinctly, is the sum and the substance of
all information which I could gather prior to 1835-36; and while
I do not entirely credit these statements, yet the earnest, straightforward
agreement of the natives has impressed me so that I narrate
it here. It certainly seems as though this enumeration of the
old Aleutes was painfully short.</p>

<p>Then, again, with regard to the probable truth of the foregoing
statement of the natives, perhaps I should call attention to the fact
that the entire sum of seal-life in 1836, as given by them, is just
four thousand one hundred, of all classes, distributed as I have indicated
above. Now, on turning to Bishop Veniaminov, by whom
was published the only statement of any kind in regard to the killing
on these islands from 1817 to 1837 (the year when he finished
his work), I find that he makes a record of slaughter of seals in the
year 1836 of four thousand and fifty-two, which were killed and
taken for their skins; but if the natives’ statements are right, then
only fifty seals were left on the island for 1837, in which year,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
however, four thousand two hundred and twenty were again killed,
according to the bishop’s table, and according to which there was also
a steady increase in the size of this return from that date along up
to 1850, when the Russians governed their catch by the market
alone, always having more seals than they knew what to do with.</p>

<p>Again, in this connection, the natives say that until 1847 the
practice on these islands was to kill indiscriminately both females
and males for skins; but after this year, 1847, that strict respect
now paid to the breeding-seals, and exemption of all females, was
enforced for the first time, and has continued up to date.</p>

<p>In attempting to form an approximate conception of what the
seals were or might have been in those early days, as they spread
themselves over the hauling and breeding grounds of these remarkable
islands, I have been thrown entirely upon the vague statements
given to me by the natives and one or two of the first American
pioneers in Alaska. The only Russian record which touches ever
so lightly upon the subject<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> contains a remarkable statement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
which is, in the light of my surveys, simply ridiculous now—that is,
that the number of fur-seals on St. George during the first years
of Russian occupation was nearly as great as that on St. Paul. A
most superficial examination of the geological character portrayed
on the accompanying maps of those two islands will satisfy any unprejudiced
mind as to the total error of such a statement. Why,
a mere tithe only of the multitudes which repair to St. Paul in perfect
comfort over the sixteen or twenty miles of splendid landing
ground found thereon could visit St. George, when all of the
coast-line fit for their reception on this island is a scant two and
a half miles; but, for that matter, there was at the time of my arrival
and in the beginning of my investigation a score of equally
wild and incredible legends afloat in regard to the rookeries of St.
Paul and St. George. Finding, therefore, that the whole work
must be undertaken <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de novo</i>, I went about it without further
delay.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that there is, frankly stated, nothing that
serves as a guide to a fair or even an approximate estimate as to
the numbers of the fur-seals on these two islands, prior to the result
of my labor.</p>

<p>At the close of my investigation during the first season of my work
on the ground in 1872 the fact became evident that the breeding
seals obeyed implicitly an imperative and instinctive natural law of
distribution—a law recognized by each and every seal upon the
rookeries prompted by a fine consciousness of necessity to its own
well-being. The breeding-grounds occupied by them were, therefore,
invariably covered by the seals in exact ratio, greater or less,
as the area upon which they rested was larger or smaller. They
always covered the ground evenly, never crowding in at one place
here to scatter out there. The seals lie just as thickly together
where the rookery is boundless in its eligible area to their rear and
unoccupied by them as they do in the little strips which are abruptly
cut off and narrowed by rocky walls behind. For instance,
on a rod of ground under the face of bluffs which hem it in to the
land from the sea there are just as many seals, no more and no less, as
will be found on any other rod of rookery ground throughout the
whole list, great and small—always exactly so many seals, under
any and all circumstances, to a given area of breeding-ground.
There are just as many cows, bulls, and pups on a square rod at
Nah Speel, near the village, where in 1874, all told, there were only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
seven or eight thousand, as there are on any square rod at Northeast
Point, where a million of them congregate.</p>

<p>This fact being determined, it is evident that just in proportion
as the breeding-grounds of the fur-seal on these islands expand or
contract in area from their present dimensions, so the seals will increase
or diminish in number.</p>

<p>That discovery at the close of the season of 1872 of this law of
distribution gave me at once the clue I was searching for, in order
to take steps by which I could arrive at a sound conclusion as to
the entire number of seals herding on the Pribylov group.</p>

<p>I noticed, and time has confirmed my observation, that the period
for taking these boundaries of the rookeries, so as to show this
exact margin of expansion at the week of its greatest volume, or
when they are as full as they are to be for the season, is between
July 10th and 20th of every year—not a day earlier and not many
days later. After July 20th the regular system of compact, even
organization, breaks up. The seals then scatter out in pods or
clusters, the pups leading the way, straying far back: the same
number then instantly cover twice and thrice as much ground as
they did the day or week before, when they laid in solid masses and
were marshalled on the rookery ground proper.</p>

<p>There is no more difficulty in surveying these seal-margins during
this week or ten days in July than there is in drawing sights
along and around the curbs of a stone fence surrounding a field.
The breeding-seals remain perfectly quiet under your eyes all over
the rookery and almost within your touch, everywhere on the outside
of their territory that you may stand or walk. The margins
of massed life, which are indicated on the topographical surveys of
these breeding-grounds of St. Paul and St. George, are as clean cut
and as well defined against the soil and vegetation as is the shading
on my maps. There is not the least difficulty in making such surveys,
and in making them correctly.</p>

<p>Without following such a system of enumeration, persons may
look over these swarming myriads between Southwest Point and
Novastoshnah, guessing vaguely and wildly, at any figure from
one million up to ten or twelve millions, as has been done repeatedly.
How few people know what a million really is! It is very
easy to talk of a million, but it is a tedious task to count it off: this
makes a statement as to “millions” decidedly more conservative
when the labor has been accomplished. After a thorough survey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
of all these great areas of reproduction the following presentation
of the actual number of seals massed upon St. Paul is a fair

<p>The figures thus given show a grand massing of 3,193,420 breeding-seals
and their young. This enormous aggregate is entirely
exclusive of the great numbers of the non-breeding-seals that, as
we have pointed out, are never permitted to come up on those
grounds which have been surveyed and epitomized by the table
just exhibited. That class of seals, the “holluschickie,” in general
terms (all males, and those to which the killing is confined), come
up on the land and sea-beaches between the rookeries, in immense
straggling droves, going to and from the sea at irregular intervals,
from the beginning to the closing of an entire season. The
method of the “holluschickie” on these hauling-grounds is not
systematic—it is not distinct, like the manner and law prescribed
and obeyed by the breeding-seals—therefore it is impossible to
arrive at a definite enumeration, and my estimate for them is purely
a matter of my individual judgment. I think they may be safely
rated at 1,500,000; thus, we have the wonderful number of 4,700,000
fur-seals assembled every summer on the rocky rookeries and
sandy hauling-grounds of the Pribylov Islands!</p>

<p>No language can express adequately your sensations when you
first stroll over the outskirts of any one of those great breeding
grounds of the fur-seal on St. Paul’s Island. There is no impression
on my mind more fixed than is the one stamped thereon during
the afternoon of a July day when I walked around the inner
margins of that immense rookery at Northeast Point—indeed,
while I pause to think of this subject, I am fairly rendered dumb
by the vivid spectacle which rises promptly to my view—I am
conscious of my inability to render that magnificent animal-show
justice in definition. It is a vast camp of parading squadrons
which file and deploy over slopes from the summit of a lofty hill a
mile down to where it ends on the south shore—a long mile, smooth
and gradual from the sea to that hill-top; the parade-ground lying
between is also nearly three-quarters of a mile in width, sheer and
unbroken. Now, upon that area before my eyes, this day and date
of which I have spoken, were the forms of not less than three-fourths
of a million seals—pause a moment—think of the number—three-fourths
of a million seals, moving in one solid mass from
sleep to frolicsome gambols, backward, forward, over, around,
changing and interchanging their heavy squadrons, until the whole
mind is so confused and charmed by the vastness of mighty hosts
that it refuses to analyze any further. Then, too, I remember that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
the day was one of exceeding beauty for that region—it was a
swift alternation overhead of those characteristic rain-fogs, between
the succession of which the sun breaks out with transcendent
brilliancy through misty halos about it. This parade-field
reflected the light like a mirror, and the seals, when they broke
apart here and there for a moment, just enough to show its surface,
seemed as though they walked upon the water. What a scene
to put upon canvas—that amphibian host involved in those alternate
rainbow lights and blue-gray shadows of the fog!</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">[<em>The shaded belt is that ground wholly covered by Fur-Seal Rookeries.</em>]</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While Novastoshnah is the largest, yet in some respects I consider
Tolstoi, with its bluffs and its long sweep which takes in the
sands of English Bay, to be the most picturesque, though it be not
the most impressive rookery—especially when that parade-ground
belonging to it is reached by the climbing seals.</p>

<p>From Tolstoi at this point, circling around three miles to
Zapadnie, is the broad sand-beach of English Bay, upon which and
back over its gently rising flats are the great hauling-grounds of
the “holluschickie,” which I have indicated on the general map,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
and to which I made reference in a previous section of this chapter.
Gazing at these myriads of “bachelor-seals” spread out in their
restless hundreds and hundreds of thousands upon this ground,
one feels the utter impotency of verbal description, and reluctantly
shuts his note and sketch books to view it with renewed fascination
and perfect helplessness.</p>

</figure>

<p>Looking from the village across the cove and down upon the
lagoon, still another strange contradiction appears—at least it
seems a natural contradiction to one’s usual ideas. Here we see
the Lagoon rookery, a reach of ground upon which some twenty-five
or thirty thousand breeding-seals come out regularly every
year during the appointed time, and go through their whole elaborate
system of reproduction, without showing the slightest concern
for or attention to the scene directly east of them and across that
shallow slough not eighty feet in width. There are the great
slaughtering fields of St. Paul Island; there are the sand-flats
where every seal has been slaughtered for years upon years back,
for its skin; and even as we take this note, forty men are standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
there knocking down a drove of two or three thousand “holluschickie”
for their day’s work, and as they labor, the whacking of
their clubs and the sounds of their voices must be as plain to those
breeding-seals, which are not one hundred feet from them, as it is
to us, a quarter of a mile distant! In addition to this enumeration
of disturbances, well calculated to amaze, and dismay, and drive off
every seal within its influence, are the decaying bodies of the last
year’s catch—seventy-five thousand or eighty-five thousand unburied
carcasses—that are sloughing away into the sand which,
two or three seasons from now, nature will, in its infinite charity,
cover with the greenest of all green grasses. The whitened bones
and grinning skulls of over three million seals have bleached out on
that slaughtering-spot, and are buried below its surface.</p>

<p>Directly under the north face of the village hill, where it falls
to the narrow flat between its feet and the cove, the natives have
sunk a well. It was excavated in 1857, they say, and subsequently
deepened to its present condition in 1868. It is twelve feet deep,
and the diggers said that they found bones of the sea-lion and fur-seal
thickly distributed every foot down, from top to bottom. How
much lower these osteological remains of prehistoric pinnipeds
can be found no one knows as yet. The water here, on that account,
has never been fit to drink, or even to cook with, but, being
soft, was and is used by the natives for washing clothes, etc. Most
likely, it records a spot upon which the Russians, during the heyday
of their early occupation, drove the unhappy visitors of Nah Speel
to slaughter. There is no Golgotha known to man elsewhere in
the world as extensive as this one of St. Paul.</p>

<p>Yet, the natives say that this Lagoon rookery is a new feature
in the distribution of the seals; that when the people first came
here and located a part of the present village, in 1824 up to 1847,
there never had been a breeding-seal on that Lagoon rookery of
to-day; so they have hauled up here from a small beginning, not
very long ago, until they have attained their present numerical expansion,
in spite of all these exhibitions of butchery of their kind,
executed right under their eyes, and in full knowledge of their nostrils,
while the groans and low moanings of their stricken species,
stretched out beneath the clubs of the sealers, must have been and
are far plainer in their ears than they are in our own!</p>

<p>Still they come—they multiply, and they increase—knowing so
well that they belong to a class which intelligent men never did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
molest. To-day at least they know it, or they would not submit to
these manifestations which we have just cited, so close to their
knowledge.</p>

<p>The Lagoon rookery, however, never can be a large one, on account
of the very nature of this ground selected by the seals; it is
a bar simply pushed up beyond the surf-wash of boulders, water-worn
and rounded, which has almost enclosed and cut away the
Lagoon from its parent sea. In my opinion, the time is not far distant
when that estuary will be another inland lake of St. Paul,
walled out from salt water and freshened by rain and melting snow,
as are the other pools, lakes, and lakelets on the island.</p>

<p>Zapadnie, in itself, is something like the Reef plateau on its
eastern face, for it slopes up gradually and gently to the parade-plateau
above—a parade-ground not so smooth, however, being
very rough and rocky, but which the seals enjoy. Just around the
point, a low strip of rocky bar and beach connects it with the
ridge-walls of Southwest Point, a very small breeding rookery, so
small that it is not worthy of a survey, is located here. I think,
probably, on account of the nature of the ground, that it will never
hold its own, and is more than likely abandoned by this time.</p>

<p>One of the prehistoric villages, the village of Pribylov’s time,
was established here between that point and the cemetery ridge,
on which the northern wing of Zapadnie rests. An old burying-ground,
with its characteristic Russian crosses and faded pictures
of the saints, is plainly marked on the ridge. It was at this little
bight of sandy landing that Pribylov’s men first came ashore and
took possession of the island, while others in the same season proceeded
to Northeast Point and to the north shore to establish
settlements of their own order. When the indiscriminate sealing of
1868 was in progress, one of the parties lived here, and a salt-house
which was then erected by them still stands. It is in a very fair
state of preservation, although it has never been occupied since,
except by the natives who come over here from the village in the
summer to pick those berries of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empetrum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rubus</i>, which
abound in the greatest profusion around the rough and rocky
flats that environ a little lake adjacent. The young people of St.
Paul are very fond of this berry-festival, so-called among themselves,
and they stay there every August, camping out, a week or
ten days at a time, before returning to their homes in the village.</p>

<p>So abundant have been the seals that no driving of animals from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
the parade-grounds of Zapadnie has ever been made since 1869. It
is easily reached, however, if it were desirable to do so.</p>

<p>Polavina has also been an old settlement site, and, for the reason
cited at Zapadnie, no “holluschickie” have been driven from this
point since 1872, though it is one of the easiest worked. It was in
the Russian times a pet sealing-ground with them. The remains
of an old village have nearly all been buried in the sand near the
lake, and there is really no mark of its early habitation, unless it be
the singular effect of a human graveyard being dug out and despoiled
by the attrition of seal bodies and flippers. The old cemetery
just above and to the right of the barrabkie, near the little
lake, was originally established, so the natives told me, far away
from the hauling of the “holluschickie.” It was, when I saw it in
1876, in a melancholy state of ruin. A thousand young seals (at
least) moved off from its surface as I came up, and they had actually
trampled out many sandy graves, rolling the bones and skulls of
Aleutian ancestry in every direction. Beyond this ancient demesne
which the natives established long ago, as a house of refuge during
the winter when they were trapping foxes, looking to the west over
the lake, is a large expanse of low, flat swale and tundra, which is terminated
by the rocky ridge of Kamminista. Every foot of it has
been placed there subsequent to the original elevation of the island
by direct action of the sea, beyond question. It is covered with a
thick growth of the rankest sphagnum, which quakes and trembles
like a bog under one’s feet, but over which the most beautiful
mosses ever and anon crop out, including that characteristic floral
display before referred to in speaking of the island. Most of the
way from the village up to the Northeast Point, as will be seen by
a cursory glance at the map, with the exception of this bluff of
Polavina and the terraced table setting back from its face to Polavina
Sopka, the whole island is slightly elevated above the level of
the sea, and its coast-line is lying just above and beyond the reach
of the surf, where great ridges of sand have been piled up by the
wind, capped with sheafs and tufts of rank-growing <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elymus</i>.</p>

<p>Near the village, at that little bight mapped as Zoltoi, is a famous
rendezvous for the “holluschickie,” and from this place during the
season the natives make regular drives, having only to step out
from their houses in the morning and walk a few rods to find their
fur-bearing quarry.</p>

<p>Passing over Zoltoi on our way down to the point, we quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
come to a basaltic ridge or back-bone over which the sand has been
rifted by strong winds, and which supports a rank and luxuriant
growth of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elymus</i> and other grasses, with beautiful flowers.
A few hundred feet farther along our course brings us in full view,
as we look to the south, of one of the most entrancing spectacles
that seals afford to man. We glance below upon and survey a
full sweep of the Reef rookery along a grand promenade ground,
which slopes gently to the eastward and trends southward down to
the water from its abrupt walls bordering on the sea to the
west; it is a parade plateau as smooth as the floor of a ball-room,
2,000 feet in length, from 500 to 1,000 feet in width, over which
multitudes of “holluschickie” are filing in long strings or deploying
in vast platoons, hundreds abreast, in an unceasing march and
countermarch. The breath that rises into the cold air from a hundred
thousand hot throats hangs like clouds of white steam in the
gray fog itself; indeed, it may be said to be a seal-fog peculiar to
such a spot, while the din, the roar arising over all, defies adequate
description.</p>

<p>We notice to our right and to our left an immense solid mass
of the breeding-seals at Gorbotch, and another stretching and
trending nearly a mile from our feet, far around to the Reef Point
below and opposite that parade-ground, with here and there a
neutral passage left open for the “holluschickie” to go down and
come up from the waves.</p>

<p>The adaptation of this ground of the Reef rookery to the requirements
of the seal is perfect. It so lies that it falls gently from
its high Zoltoi Bay margin, on the west, to the sea on the east, and
upon its broad expanse not a solitary puddle of mud-spotting is to
be seen, though everything is reeking with moisture, and the fog
even dissolves into rain as we view the scene. Every trace of vegetation
upon this parade has been obliterated. A few tufts of grass,
capping the summits of those rocky hillocks, indicated on the eastern
and middle slope, are the only signs of botanical life which the
seals have suffered to remain.</p>

<p>A small rock, “Seevitchie Kammin,” five or six hundred feet
right to the southward and out at sea, is also covered with the black
and yellow forms of fur-seals and sea-lions. It is environed by
shoal-reefs, rough and kelp-grown, which navigators prudently
avoid.</p>

<p>At Lukannon and Ketavie there is a joint blending of two large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
breeding-grounds, their continuity broken by a short reach of sea-wall
right under and at the eastern foot of Lukannon Hill. The
appearance of these rookeries is, like all the others, peculiar to
themselves. There is a rounded, bulging hill, at the foot of Lukannon
Bay, which rises perhaps one hundred and sixty or one hundred
and seventy feet from the sea, abruptly at the point, but
swelling out gently up from the sand-dunes in Lukannon Bay to
its summit at the northwest and south. The big rookery rests
upon its northern slope. Here is a beautiful adaptation of the finest
drainage, with a profusion of those rocky nodules scattered
everywhere over it, upon which the female seals so delight in
resting.</p>

<p>Standing on the bald summit of Lukannon Hill, we turn to the
south, and look over Ketavie<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Point, where another large aggregate
of rookery life rests under our eye. The hill falls away into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
a series of faintly terraced tables, which drop down to a flat that
again abruptly descends to the sea at Ketavie Point. Between us
and Ketavie rookery is the parade-ground of Lukannon,—a sight
almost as grand as is that on the Reef which we have feebly attempted
to portray. The sand-dunes to the west and to the north
are covered with the most luxuriant grass, abruptly emarginated by
sharp abrasions of the hauling-seals: this is shown very clearly
on my general map. Ketavie Point is a solid basaltic shelf. Lukannon
Hill, the summit of it, is composed of volcanic tufa and
cement, with irregular cubes and fragments of pure basalt scattered
all over its flipper-worn slopes. This is that place, down along the
flat shoals of Lukannon Bay, where the sand-dunes are most characteristic,
as they rise in their wind-whirled forms just above surf-wash.
Here also is where the natives come from the village during
the early mornings of the season for driving, to get any number of
“holluschickie” required.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful sight, glancing from the summit of this great
rookery hill, up to the north over that low reach of the coast to
Tonkie Mees, where the waves seem to roll in with crests which rise
in unbroken ridges for a mile in length each, ere they break so
grandly and uniformly on the beach. In these rollers the “holluschickie”
are playing like sea-birds, seeming to sport the most joyously
at the very moment when a heavy billow breaks and falls
upon them.</p>

<p>The precipitous shore-line of St. George is enough in itself to explain
the small number of seals found there, when contrasted with
the swarming myriads of her more favorably adapted sister island.
Nevertheless that Muscovitic sailor, Pribylov, not knowing then of
the existence of St. Paul, was as well satisfied as if he had possessed
the boundless universe when he first found it. As in the
case of St. Paul Island, I have been unable to learn much here in
regard to the early status of the rookeries, none of the natives having
any real information. The drift of their sentiment goes to show
that there never was a great assemblage of fur-seals on St. George—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
fact, never as many as there are to-day, insignificant as the exhibit
is, compared with that of St. Paul. They say that at first the
sea-lions owned this island, and that the Russians, becoming cognizant
of the fact, made a regular business of driving off the “seevitchie,”
in order that fur-seals might be encouraged to land.
Touching this statement, with my experience on St. Paul, where
there is no conflict at all between the fifteen or twenty thousand
sea-lions which breed around on the outer edge of the seal rookeries
there and at Southwest Point, I cannot agree to the St. George
legend. I am inclined to believe, however—indeed, it is more than
probable—that there were a great many more sea-lions on and
about St. George before it was occupied by men—a hundredfold
greater, perhaps, than now, because a sea-lion is an exceedingly
timid, cowardly creature when it is in the proximity of man, and
will always desert any resting-place where it is constantly brought
into contact with him.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The rookeries on this island, being so much less in volume, are
not especially noted—still, one of them, “Starry Arteel,” is unique
indeed, lying as it does in a bold sweep from the sea up a very
steep slope to a point where the bluffs bordering it seaward are
over four hundred feet in vertical declination. The seals crowd
just as closely to the edge of this precipice along its entire face as
they do at the tide-level. It is a very strange sight for that visitor
who may sail under these bluffs with a boat in fair weather for landing,
and, as you walk the beach, above which the cliff-wall frowns
a sheer five hundred feet, there, directly over your head, the craning
necks and twisting forms of restless seals, appear as if ready to
launch out and fall below, ever and anon, as you glance upward,
so closely and boldly do they press to the very edge of the precipice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
I have been repeatedly astonished at an amazing power
possessed by the fur-seal of resistance to shocks which would certainly
kill any other animal. To explain clearly, the reader will
observe by reference to the maps that there are a great many cliffy
places between the rookeries on the shore-lines of the islands.
Some of these bluffs are more than one hundred feet in abrupt elevation
above the surf and rocks awash below. Frequently “holluschickie,”
in ones, or twos, or threes, will stray far away back from
the great masses of their kind and fall asleep in the thick grass and
herbage which covers these mural reaches. Sometimes they will
repose and rest very close to the edge, and then as you come
tramping along you discover and startle them and yourself alike.
They, blinded by their first transports of alarm, leap promptly over
the brink, snorting, coughing, and spitting as they go. Curiously
peering after them and looking down upon the rocks, fifty to one
hundred feet below, instead of seeing their stunned and motionless
bodies, you will invariably catch sight of them rapidly scrambling
into the water, and, when in it, swimming off like arrows from the
bow. Three “holluschickie” were thus inadvertently surprised by
me on the edge of the west face to Otter Island. They plunged over
from an elevation there not less than two hundred feet in sheer descent,
and I distinctly saw them fall; in scrambling, whirling evolutions,
down, thumping upon the rocky shingle beneath, from
which they bounded as they struck, like so many rubber balls.
Two of them never moved after the rebound ceased; but the third
one reached the water and swam away swift as a bird on the wing.</p>

<p>While they seem to escape without bodily injury incident to
such hard falls as ensue from dropping fifty or sixty feet upon pebbly
beaches and rough boulders below, and even greater elevations,
yet I am inclined to think that some internal injuries are necessarily
sustained in almost every case, which soon develop and cause
death. The excitement and the vitality of the seal at the moment
of the terrific shock are able to sustain and conceal a real injury
for the time being.</p>

<p>Driving the “holluschickie” on St. George, owing to the relative
scantiness of hauling area for those animals there, and consequent
small numbers found upon these grounds at any one time, is
a very arduous series of daily exercises on the part of the natives
who attend to it. Glancing at the map, the marked considerable
distance over an exceedingly rough road will be noticed between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
Zapadnie and the village, yet in 1872 eleven different drives across
the island of four hundred to five hundred seals each were made in
the short four weeks of that season.</p>

<p>The peculiarly rough character to this trail is given by large,
loose, sharp-edged basaltic boulders which are strewn thickly over
all those lower levels that bridge the island between the high
bluffs at Starry Arteel and the slopes of Ahluckeyak Hill. The
summits of the two broader, higher plateaux, east and west respectively,
are comparatively smooth and easy to travel over, and so is
the sea-level flat at Zapadnie itself. On the map of St. George a
number of very small ponds will be noticed. They are the fresh-water
reservoirs of the island. The two largest of these are near
the summit of this rough divide. The seal-trail from Zapadnie to
the village runs just west of them and comes out on the north shore,
a little to the eastward of the hauling-grounds of Starry Arteel,
where it forks and unites with that path. A direct line between
the village and Zapadnie, though nearly a mile shorter on the chart,
is equal to five miles more of distance by reason of its superlative
rocky inequalities.</p>

<p>One question is always sure to be asked in this connection. The
query is: “At the present rate of killing seals it will not be long
ere they are exterminated—how much longer will they last?” My
answer is now as it was then: “Provided matters are conducted on
the Seal Islands in the future as they are to-day, 100,000 male seals
under the age of five years and over one may be safely taken every
year from the Pribylov Islands without the slightest injury to the regular
birth-rate or natural increase thereon; provided also that the
fur-seals are not visited by plagues or by pests, or any such abnormal
cause for their destruction, which might be beyond the control of
men, and to which, like any other great body of animal life, they
must ever be subjected to the danger of.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> From my calculations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
given above it will be seen that 1,000,000 pups or young seals, in
round numbers, are born upon these islands of the Pribylov group
every year. Of this million, one-half are males. These 500,000
young males, before they leave the islands for sea during October
and November, and when they are between five or six months old,
fat, and hardy, have suffered but a trifling loss in numbers—say one
per cent.—while on and about the islands of their birth, surrounding
which and upon which they have no enemies whatever to speak of;
but after they get well down to the Pacific, spread out over an immense
area of watery highways in quest of piscatorial food, they form
the most helpless of their kind to resist or elude the murderous
teeth and carnivorous attacks of basking sharks<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and killer-whales.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
By these agencies, during their absence from the islands until their
reappearance in the following year, and in July, they are so perceptibly
diminished in number that I do not think, fairly considered,
more than one-half of the legion which left the ground of their
birth last October come up the next July to these favorite landing-places—that
is, only 250,000 of them return out of the 500,000
born last year. The same statement in every respect applies to the
going and the coming of the 500,000 female pups, which are identical
in size, shape, and behavior.</p>

<p>As yearlings, however, these 250,000 survivors of last year’s
birth have become strong, lithe, and active swimmers, and when
they again leave the hauling grounds, as before, in the fall, they are
fully as able as are the older class to take care of themselves, and
when they reappear next year, at least 225,000 of them safely return
in the second season after birth. From this on I believe that they
live out their natural lives of fifteen to twenty years each, the death-rate
now caused by the visitation of marine enemies affecting them
in the aggregate but slightly. And, again, the same will hold good
touching the females, the average natural life of which, however, I
take to be only nine or ten years each.</p>

<p>Out of these two hundred and twenty-five thousand young males
we are required to save only one-fifteenth of their number to pass
over to the breeding-grounds, and meet there the two hundred and
twenty-five thousand young females; in other words, the polygamous
habit of this animal is such that, by its own volition, I do not think
that more than one male annually out of fifteen born is needed on
the breeding-grounds in the future; but in my calculations, to be
within the margin and to make sure that I save two-year-old males
enough every season, I will more than double this proportion, and
set aside every fifth one of the young males in question. That will
leave one hundred and eighty thousand seals, in good condition,
that can be safely killed every year, without the slightest injury to
the perpetuation of the stock itself forever in all of its original
integrity.</p>

<p>In the above showing I have put a very extreme estimate
upon that loss sustained at sea by the pup-seals—too large, I am
morally certain; but, in attempting to draw this line safely, I wish
to place the matter in the very worst light in which it can be put,
and to give the seals the full benefit of every doubt. Surely I have
clearly presented the case, and certainly no one will question the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
premises after they have studied the habit and disposition of the
rookeries; hence, it is a positive and tenable statement, that no
danger of the slightest appreciable degree of injury to the interests
of the Government on the Seal Islands of Alaska exists, as long
as the present law protecting it, and the management executing it,
continues.</p>

<p>These fur-seals of the Pribylov group, after leaving the islands
in the autumn and early winter, do not visit land again until the
time of their return, in the following spring and early summer, to
these same rookery and hauling-grounds, unless they touch, as they
are navigating their lengthened journey back, at the Russian Islands,
Copper and Bering, seven hundred miles to the westward of
the Pribylov group. They leave our islands by independent squads,
each one looking out for itself. Apparently all turn by common
consent to the south, disappearing toward the horizon, and are
soon lost in the vast expanse below, where they spread themselves
over the entire Pacific as far south as the 48th and even the
47th parallels of north latitude: within this immense area between
Japan and Oregon, doubtless, many extensive submarine fishing-shoals
and banks are known to them; at least, it is definitely
understood that Bering Sea does not contain them long when they
depart from the breeding rookeries and the hauling-grounds therein.
While it is carried in mind that they sleep and rest in the
water with soundness and with the greatest comfort on its surface,
and that even when around the land, during the summer, they
frequently put off from the beaches to take a bath and a quiet
snooze just beyond the surf, we can readily agree that it is no inconvenience
whatever, when the reproductive functions have been
discharged, and their coats renewed, for them to stay the balance
of the time in their most congenial element—the briny deep.</p>

<p>That these animals are preyed upon extensively by killer-whales
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orca gladiator</i>), in especial, and by sharks, and probably other
submarine foes now unknown, is at once evident; for, were they
not held in check by some such cause, they would, as they exist
to-day on St. Paul, quickly multiply, by arithmetical progression,
to so great an extent that the island, nay, Bering Sea itself, could
not contain them. The present annual killing of one hundred
thousand out of a yearly total of over a million males does not,
in an appreciable degree, diminish the seal-life, or interfere in
the slightest with its regular, sure perpetuation on the breeding-grounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
every year. We may, therefore, properly look upon this
aggregate of four and five millions of fur-seals, as we see them every
season on these Pribylov Islands, as that maximum limit of increase
assigned to them by natural law. The great equilibrium which
nature holds in life upon this earth must be sustained at St. Paul
as well as elsewhere.</p>

<p>Think of the enormous food-consumption of these rookeries and
hauling-grounds; what an immense quantity of finny prey must
pass down their voracious throats as every year rolls by! A creature
so full of life, strung with nerves, muscles like bands of steel, cannot
live on air, or absorb it from the sea. Their food is fish, to the
practical exclusion of all other diet. I have never seen them touch,
or disturb with the intention of touching it, one solitary example in
the flocks of water-fowl which rest upon the surface of the water
all about the islands. I was especially careful in noting this, because
it seemed to me that the canine armature of their mouths
must suggest flesh for food at times as well as fish; but fish we
know they eat. Whole windrows of the heads of cod and wolf-fishes,
bitten off by these animals at the nape, were washed up on
the south shore of St. George during a gale in the summer of 1873.
This pelagic decapitation evidently marked the progress and the
appetite of a band of fur-seals to the windward of the island, as
they passed into and through a stray school of these fishes.</p>

<p>How many pounds per diem is required by an adult seal, and
taken by it when feeding, is not certain in my mind. Judging
from the appetite, however, of kindred animals, such as sea-lions
fed in confinement at Woodward’s Gardens, San Francisco, I can
safely say that forty pounds for a full-grown fur-seal is a fair allowance,
with at least ten or twelve pounds per diem to every adult
female, and not much less, if any, to the rapidly growing pups and
young “holluschickie.” Therefore, this great body of four and
five millions of hearty, active animals which we know on the Seal
Islands, must consume an enormous amount of such food every
year. They cannot average less than ten pounds of fish per diem,
which gives the consumption, as exhibited by their appetite, of over
six million tons of fish every year! What wonder, then, that nature
should do something to hold these active fishermen in check.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span></p>

<p>During the winter solstice—between the lapse of the autumnal
and the verging of the vernal equinoxes—in order to get this enormous
food-supply, the fur-seals are necessarily obliged to disperse
over a very large area of fishing-ground, ranging throughout the
North Pacific, five thousand miles across between Japan and the
Straits of Fuca. In feeding, they are brought to the southward all
this time; and, as they go, they come more and more in contact
with those natural enemies peculiar to the sea of these southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
latitudes, which are almost strangers and are really unknown to the
waters of Bering Sea; for I did not observe, with the exception of
ten or twelve perhaps, certainly no more, killer-whales, a single
marine disturbance, or molestation, during the three seasons which
I passed upon the islands, that could be regarded in the slightest
degree inimical to the peace and life of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinnipedia</i>; and thus,
from my observation, I am led to believe that it is not until they
descend well to the south of the Aleutian Islands, and in the North
Pacific, that they meet with sharks to any extent, and are diminished
by the butchery of the killer whales.</p>

<p>But I did observe a very striking exhibition, however, of this
character one afternoon while looking over Lukannon Bay. I saw
a “killer” chasing the alert “holluschickie” out beyond the breakers,
when suddenly, in an instant, the cruel cetacean was turned
toward the beach in hot pursuit, and in less time than this is read
the ugly brute was high and dry upon the sands. The natives
were called, and a great feast was in prospect when I left the carcass.</p>

<p>But this was the only instance of the orca in pursuit of seals
that came directly under my observation; hence, though it does
undoubtedly capture a few here every year, yet it is an insignificant
cause of destruction, on account of its rarity.</p>

<p>The young fur-seals going out to sea for the first time, and following
in the wake of their elders, are the clumsy members of the
family. When they go to sleep on the surface of the water, they
rest much sounder than the others; and their alert and wary nature,
which is handsomely developed ere they are two seasons old,
is in its infancy. Hence, I believe that vast numbers of them are
easily captured by marine foes, as they are stupidly sleeping, or
awkwardly fishing.</p>

<p>I must not be understood as saying that fish alone constitute the
diet of the Pribylov pinnipeds; I know that they feed, to a limited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
extent, upon crustaceans and upon the squid (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Loligo</i>), also eating
tender algoid sprouts; I believe that the pup-seals live for the first
five or six months at sea largely, if not wholly, upon crustaceans
and squids; they are not agile enough, in my opinion, to fish successfully,
in any great degree, when they first depart from the
rookeries.</p>

<p>In this connection I wish to record an impression very strongly
made upon my mind, in regard to their diverse behavior when
out at sea away from the islands, and when congregated thereon.
As I have plainly exhibited in the foregoing, they are practically
without fear of man when he visits them on the land of their birth
and recreation; but the same seal that noticed you with quiet indifference
at St. Paul, in June and July, and the rest of the season
while he was there, or gambolled around your boat when you rowed
from the ship to shore, as a dog will play about your horses when
you drive from the gate to the house, that same seal, when you
meet him in one of the passes of the Aleutian chain, one hundred
or two hundred miles away from here, as the case may be, or to the
southward of that archipelago, is the shyest and wariest creature
your ingenuity can define. Happy are you in getting but a single
glimpse of him, first; you will never see him after, until he hauls
out, and winks and blinks across Lukannon sands.</p>

<p>But the companionship and the exceeding number of the seals,
when assembled together annually, makes them bold; largely due,
perhaps, to their fine instinctive understanding, dating, probably,
back many years, seeming to know that man, after all, is not wantonly
destroying them; and what he takes, he only takes from the
ravenous maw of the killer-whale or the saw-tipped teeth of the
Japan shark. As they sleep in the water, off the Straits of Fuca,
and the northwest coast as far as Dixon’s Sound, the Indians belonging
to that region surprise them with spears and rifle, capturing
quite a number every year, chiefly pups and yearlings.</p>

<p>When fur-seals were noticed, by myself, far away from these
islands, at sea, I observed that then they were as shy and as wary
as the most timorous animal would be, in dreading man’s proximity—sinking
instantly on apprehending the approach or presence
of the ship, seldom to reappear to my gaze. But, when
gathered in such immense numbers at the Pribylov Islands, they
are suddenly metamorphosed into creatures wholly indifferent to
my person. It must cause a very curious sentiment in the mind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
him who comes for the first time, during a summer season, to the
Island of St. Paul—where, when the landing boat or lighter carries
him ashore from the vessel, this whole short marine journey is enlivened
by the gambols and aquatic evolutions of fur-seal convoys
to the “bidarrah,” which sport joyously and fearlessly round and
round his craft, as she is rowed lustily ahead by the natives; the
fur-seals then, of all classes, “holluschickie” principally, pop their
dark heads up out of the sea, rising neck and shoulders erect above
the surface, to peer and ogle at him and at his boat, diving quickly
to reappear just ahead or right behind, hardly beyond striking distance
from the oars. These gymnastics of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Callorhinus</i> are not wholly
performed thus in silence, for it usually snorts and chuckles with
hearty reiteration.</p>

<p>The sea-lion up here also manifest much the same marine interest,
and gives the voyager an exhibition quite similar to the one
which I have just spoken of, when a small boat is rowed in the
neighborhood of its shore rookery; it is not, however, so bold, confident,
and social as the fur-seal under the circumstances, and utters
only a short, stifled growl of surprise, perhaps; its mobility, however,
of vocalization is sadly deficient when compared with the scope
and compass of its valuable relative’s polyglottis.</p>

<p>The hair-seals (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phoca vitulina</i>) around these islands never approached
our boats in this manner, and I seldom caught more than
a furtive glimpse of their short, bull-dog heads when traversing the
coast by water.</p>

<p>The walrus (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosmarus obesus</i>) also, like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phoca vitulina</i>, gave undoubted
evidence of sore alarm over the presence of my boat and
crew anywhere near its proximity in similar situations, only showing
itself once or twice, perhaps, at a safe distance, by elevating
nothing but the extreme tip of its muzzle and its bleared, popping
eyes above the water; it uttered no sound except a dull, muffled
grunt, or else a choking, gurgling bellow.</p>

<p>What can be done to promote the increase of fur seals? We
cannot cause a greater number of females to be born every year
than are born now; we do not touch or disturb these females as
they grow up and live; and we never will, if the law and present
management is continued. We save double—we save more than
enough males to serve; nothing more can be done by human agency;
it is beyond our power to protect them from their deadly marine
enemies as they wander into the boundless ocean searching for food.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Aleutes selecting Holluschickie for the day’s killing at English Bay, St. Paul’s Island</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span></p>

<p>In view, therefore, of all these facts, I have no hesitation in saying,
quite confidently, that under the present rules and regulations
governing the sealing interests on these islands, the increase or
diminution of the seal-life thereon will amount to nothing in the
future; that the seals will exist, as they do exist, in all time to
come at about the same number and condition recorded by this
presentation of the author.</p>

<p>By reference to the habit of the fur-seal, which I have discussed
at length, it is now plain and beyond doubt that two-thirds of all
the males which are born, and they are equal in numbers to the
females born, are never permitted by the remaining third, strongest
by natural selection, to land upon the same breeding-ground
with the females, which always herd thereupon <em>en masse</em>. Hence
this great band of “bachelor” seals, or “holluschickie,” so fitly
termed, when it visits the island, is obliged to live apart wholly—sometimes
and in some places, miles away from the rookeries; and,
by this admirable method of nature are those seals which can be
killed without injury to the rookeries selected and held aside of
their own volition, so that the natives can visit and take them without
disturbing, to the least degree, that entire quiet of those breeding-grounds
where the stock is perpetuated.</p>

<p>The manner in which the natives capture and drive up “holluschickie”
from the hauling-grounds to the slaughter-fields near the
two villages of St. Paul and St. George, and elsewhere on the islands,
cannot be improved upon. It is in this way: At the beginning
of every sealing-season, that is, during May and June, large
bodies of the young “bachelor” seals do not haul up on land very
far from the water—a few rods at the most—and, when these first
arrivals are sought after, the natives, to capture them, are obliged
to approach slyly and run quickly between the dozing seals and the
surf, before they can take alarm and bolt into the sea; in this manner
a dozen Aleutes, running down the sand beach of English Bay,
in the early morning of some June day, will turn back from the
water thousands of seals, just as the mould-board of a plough lays
over and back a furrow of earth. When the sleeping seals are first
startled, they arise, and, seeing men between them and the water,
immediately turn, lope and scramble rapidly back up and over the
land; the natives then leisurely walk on the flanks and in the rear
of this drove thus secured, directing and driving it over to the killing-grounds,
close by the village. The task of getting up early of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
a morning, and going out to the several hauling-grounds, closely
adjacent, is really all there is of that labor expended in securing the
number of seals required for a day’s work on the killing-grounds.
The two, three, or four natives upon whom, in rotation, this duty is
devolved by the order of their chief, rise at first glimpse of dawn,
between one and two o’clock, and hasten over to Lukannon, Tolstoi,
or Zoltoi, as the case may be, “walk out” their “holluschickie,”
and have them duly on the slaughtering field before six or seven
o’clock, as a rule, in the morning. In favorable weather the “drive”
from Tolstoi consumes from two and a half to three hours’ time;
from Lukannon, about two hours, and is often done in an hour and
a half; while Zoltoi is so near by that the time is merely nominal.</p>

<p>A drove of seals on hard or firm grassy ground, in cool and moist
weather, may be driven with safety at the rate of half a mile an
hour; they can be urged along, with the expenditure of a great
many lives, however, at the speed of a mile or a mile and a quarter
per hour; but that is seldom done. An old bull-seal, fat and unwieldy,
cannot travel with the younger ones, though it can lope or
gallop as it starts across the ground as fast as an ordinary man can
run, over one hundred yards—then it fails utterly, falls to the earth
supine, entirely exhausted, hot, and gasping for breath.</p>

<p>The “holluschickie” are urged along over paths leading to
the killing-ground with very little trouble, and require only three
or four men to guide and secure as many thousand at a time. They
are permitted frequently to halt and cool off, as heating them injures
their fur. These seal-halts on the road always impressed me
with a species of sentimentalism and regard for the creatures themselves.
When the men drop back for a few moments, that awkward
shambling and scuffling of the march at once ceases, and the
seals stop in their tracks to fan themselves with their hind flippers,
while their heaving flanks give rise to subdued panting sounds. As
soon as they apparently cease to gasp for want of breath, and are
cooled off comparatively, the natives step up once more, clatter a
few bones, with a shout along the line, and this seal-shamble begins
again—their march to death and the markets of the world is taken
up anew.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span></p>

<p>I was also impressed by the singular docility and amiability of
these animals when driven along the road. They never show fight
any more than a flock of sheep would do; if, however, a few old
seals get mixed in, they usually grow so weary that they prefer to
come to a stand-still and fight rather than move; otherwise no
sign whatever of resistance is made by the drove from the moment
it is intercepted, and turned up from the hauling-grounds, to the
time of its destruction at the hands of the sealing-gang.</p>

<p>This disposition of the old seals to fight rather than endure the
panting torture of travel, is of great advantage to all parties concerned,
for they are worthless commercially, and the natives are
only too glad to let them drop behind, where they remain unmolested,
eventually returning to the sea. The fur on them is of little
or no value; their under-wool being very much shorter, coarser,
and more scant than in the younger; especially so on the posterior
parts along the median line of the back.</p>

<p>This change for the worse or deterioration of the pelage of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
fur-seal takes place, as a rule, in the fifth year of their age—it is
thickest and finest in texture during the third and fourth year of
life; hence, in driving the seals on St. Paul and St. George up
from the hauling-grounds the natives make, as far as practicable, a
selection only from males of that age. It is quite impossible, however,
to get them all of one age without an extraordinary amount of
stir and bustle, which the Aleutes do not like to precipitate; hence
the drive will be found to consist usually of a bare majority of
three and four-year-olds, the rest being two-year-olds principally,
and a very few, at wide intervals, five-year-olds, the yearlings seldom
ever getting mixed up in it.</p>

<p>As this drove progresses along that path to those slaughtering-grounds,
the seals all move in about the same way; they go ahead
with a kind of walking step and a sliding, shambling gallop. The
progression of the whole caravan is a succession of starts, spasmodic
and irregular, made every few minutes, the seals pausing to
catch their breath, making, as it were, a plaintive survey and
mute protest. Every now and then a seal will get weak in the
lumbar region, then drag its posteriors along for a short distance,
finally drop breathless and exhausted, quivering and panting, not
to revive for hours—days, perhaps—and often never. During the
driest driving-days, or those days when the temperature does not
combine with wet fog to keep the earth moist and cool, quite a
large number of the weakest animals in the drove will be thus laid
out and left on the track. If one of these prostrate seals is not too
much heated at the time, the native driver usually taps the beast
over the head and removes its skin.</p>

<p>This prostration from exertion will always happen, no matter
how carefully they are driven; and in the longer drives, such as
two and a half and five miles from Zapadnie on the west, or Polavina
on the north, to the village at St. Paul, as much as three or
four per cent. of the whole drive will be thus dropped on the road;
hence I feel satisfied, from my observation and close attention to
this feature, that a considerable number of those that are thus rejected
from the drove, and are able to rally and return to the water,
die subsequently from internal injuries sustained on the trip,
superinduced by this over-exertion. I therefore think it highly
improper and impolitic to extend drives of the “holluschickie”
over any distance on St. Paul Island exceeding a mile, or a mile
and a half—it is better for all parties concerned, and the business
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>too, that salt-houses be erected, and killing-grounds established
contiguous to all of the great hauling-grounds, two miles distant
from the village on St Paul Island, should the business ever
be developed above the present limit, or should the exigencies of
the future require a quota from all these places in order to make
up the hundred thousand which may be lawfully taken.</p>

<p>As matters are to-day, one hundred thousand seals alone on St.
Paul can be taken and skinned in less than forty working days,
within a radius of one mile and a half from the village, and from
the salt-house at Northeast Point; hence the driving, with the exception
of two experimental droves which I witnessed in 1872, has
never been made from longer distances than Tolstoi to the eastward,
Lukannon to the northward, and Zoltoi to the southward of
the killing-grounds at St Paul village. Should, however, an abnormal
season recur, in which the larger portion of days during
the right period for taking the skins be warmish and dry, it might
be necessary, in order to get even seventy-five thousand seals within
the twenty-eight or thirty days of their prime condition, for
drives to be made from the other great hauling-grounds to the
westward and northward, which are now, and have been for the
last ten years, entirely unnoticed by our sealers.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

</figure>

<p>The seals, when finally driven up on those flats between the east
landing and the village, and almost under the windows of the
dwellings, are herded there until cool and rested. Such drives are
usually made very early in the morning, at the first breaking of
day, which is half-past one to two o’clock of June and July in these
latitudes. They arrive, and cool off on the slaughtering-grounds,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>so that by six or seven o’clock, after breakfast, the able-bodied male
population turn out from the village and go down to engage in the
work of killing them. These men are dressed in their ordinary laboring-garb
of thick flannel shirts, stout cassimere or canvas pants,
over which the “tarbosar” boots are drawn. If it rains they wear
their “kamlaykas,” made of the intestines and throats of the sea-lion
and fur-seal. Thus dressed, they are each armed with a club,
a stout oaken or hickory bludgeon, which has been made particularly
for the purpose at New London, Conn., and imported here
for this especial service. Those sealing-clubs are about five or
six feet in length, three inches in diameter at their heads, and
the thickness of a man’s forearm where they are grasped by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>hands. Each native also has his stabbing-knife, his skinning-knife
and his whetstone: these are laid upon the grass convenient, when
the work of braining or knocking the seals down is in progress:
this is all the apparatus which they employ for killing and skinning.</p>

<p>When the men gather for work they are under the control of
their chosen foremen or chiefs; usually, on St. Paul, divided into
two working parties at the village, and a sub-party at Northeast
Point, where another salt-house and slaughtering-field is
established. At the signal of the chief the labor of the day begins
by the men stepping into that drove corralled on the flats and driving
out from it one hundred or one hundred and fifty seals at a
time, making what they call a “pod,” which they surround in a
circle, huddling the seals one on another as they narrow it down, until
they are directly within reach and under their clubs. Then the chief,
after he has cast his experienced eye over the struggling, writhing
“kautickie” in the centre, passes the word that such and such a
seal is bitten, that such and such a seal is too young, that such and
such a seal is too old; the attention of his men being called to
these points, he gives the word “Strike!” and instantly the heavy
clubs come down all around, and every animal eligible is stretched
out stunned and motionless, in less time, really, than I take to tell
it. Those seals spared by order of the chief now struggle from
under and over the bodies of their insensible companions and pass,
hustled off by the natives, back to the sea.</p>

<p>The clubs are dropped, the men seize the prostrate seals by the
hind flippers and drag them out so they are spread on the ground
without touching each other, then every sealer takes his knife and
drives it into the heart at a point between the fore flippers of each
stunned form; its blood gushes forth, and the quivering of the
animal presently ceases. A single stroke of a heavy oak bludgeon,
well and fairly delivered, will crush in at once the slight, thin bones
of a fur-seal’s skull, and lay the creature out almost lifeless. These
blows are, however, usually repeated two or three times with each
animal, but they are very quickly done. The bleeding, which is
immediately effected, is so speedily undertaken in order that the
strange reaction, which the sealers call “heating,” shall be delayed
for half an hour or so, or until the seals can all be drawn out and
laid in some disposition for skinning.</p>

<p>I have noticed that within less than thirty minutes from the
time a perfectly sound seal was knocked down, it had so “heated,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
owing to the day being warmer and drier than usual, that, when
touching it with my foot, great patches of hair and fur scaled off.
This is rather exceptionally rapid metamorphosis—it will, however,
take place in every instance, within an hour, or an hour and a half
on these warm days, after the first blow is struck, and the seal is
quiet in death; hence no time is lost by a prudent toyone in directing
the removal of the skins as rapidly as the seals are knocked
down and dragged out. If it is a cool day, after bleeding the first
“pod” which has been prostrated in the manner described, and
after carefully drawing the slain from the heap in which they have
fallen, so that the bodies will spread over the ground just free
from touching one another, they turn to and strike down another
“pod;” and so on, until a whole thousand or two are laid out, or
the drove, as corralled, is finished. The day, however, must be raw
and cold for this wholesale method. Then, after killing, they turn
to work and skin; but if it is a warm day every pod is skinned as
soon as it is knocked down.</p>

<p>The labor of skinning is exceedingly severe, and is trying even
to an expert, demanding long practice ere the muscles of the back
and thighs are so developed as to permit a man to bend down to,
and finish well, a fair day’s work. The knives used by the natives
for skinning are ordinary kitchen or case-handle butcher-knives.
They are sharpened to cutting edges as keen as razors, but something
about the skins of the seal, perhaps fine comminuted sand
along the abdomen, so dulls these knives, as the natives work, that
they are obliged to whet them constantly.</p>

<p>The body of the seal, preparatory to skinning, is rolled over
and balanced squarely on its back; then the native makes a single
swift cut through the skin down along the neck, chest, and belly,
from the lower jaw to the root of the tail: he uses for this purpose
his long stabbing-knife.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The fore and hind flippers are then successively
lifted, as the man straddles a seal and stoops down to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
his work over it, and a sweeping circular incision is made through
the skin on them just at the point where the body-fur ends; then,
seizing a flap of the hide on either one side or the other of the
abdomen, the man proceeds with his smaller, shorter butcher-knife,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
rapidly to cut the skin, clean and free from the body and blubber,
which he rolls over and out from the hide by hauling up on it as he
advances with his work, standing all this time stooped over the
carcass so that his hands are but slightly above it, or the ground.
This operation of skinning a fair-sized “holluschak” takes the
best men only one minute and a half, but the average time made
by the gang on the ground is about four minutes to the seal.
Nothing is left of the skin upon the carcass, save a small patch of
each upper lip on which the coarse mustache grows, the skin on
the tip of the lower jaw, and its insignificant tail. After removal
of the skin from the body of a fur-seal, the entire surface of the
carcass is covered with a more or less dense layer, or envelope, of
soft, oily blubber, which in turn completely conceals the muscles
or flesh of the trunk and neck. This fatty substance, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
we now see, resembles that met with in such seals everywhere,
only possessing that strange peculiarity not shared by any other
of its kind, of being positively overbearing and offensive in odor
to an unaccustomed human nostril. The rotting, sloughing carcasses
around about did not, when stirred up, affect me more unpleasantly
than did this strong, sickening smell of the fur-seal
blubber. It has a character and appearance intermediate between
those belonging to the adipose tissue found on the flesh of cetacea
and some carnivora.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p3420_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">The Carcass after Skinning—The Skin as taken therefrom.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This continuous envelope of blubber to the bodies of the “holluschickie”
is thickest in deposit at those points upon the breast
between the fore flippers, reaching entirely around and over the
shoulders, where it is from one inch to a little over in depth. Upon
the outer side of the chest it is not half an inch in thickness, frequently
not more than a quarter, and it thins out considerably as
it reaches the median line of the back. The neck and head are
clad by an unbroken continuation of the same material, which
varies from one-half to one-quarter of an inch in depth. Toward
the middle line of the abdominal region there is a layer of relative
greater thickness. This is coextensive with the sterno-pectoral
mass; but it does not begin to retain its volume as it extends backward,
where this fatty investment of the carcass upon the loins,
buttocks, and hinder limbs fades out finer than on the pectoro-abdominal
parts, and assumes a thickness corresponding to its
depth on the cervical and dorsal regions. As it descends on the
limbs this blubber thins out very perceptibly; and, when reaching
the flippers, it almost entirely disappears, giving way to a glistening
aureolar tissue, while the flipper skin finally descends in turn to
adhere closely and firmly to the tendinous ligamentary structures
beneath, which constitute the tips of the swimming-palms.</p>

<p>The flesh and the muscles are not lined between or within by
fat of any kind: this blubber envelope contains it all, with one
exception—that which is found in the folds of the small intestine
and about the kidneys, where there is an abundant secretion of a
harder, whiter, though still offensive-smelling fat.</p>

<p>It is quite natural for our people when they first eat a meal on
the Pribylov Islands to ask questions in regard to what seal-meat
looks and tastes like. Some of the white residents will answer,
saying that they are very fond of it cooked so and so; others will
reply that in no shape or manner can they stomach the dish. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
inquirer must himself try the effect on his own palate. I frankly
confess that I had a slight prejudice against seal-meat at first, having
preconceived ideas that it would be fishy in flavor; but I soon
satisfied myself to the contrary, and found that the flesh of young
seals not over three years old was as appetizing and toothsome as
some of the beef, mutton, and pork I was accustomed to at home.
The following precautions must be rigidly observed, however, by
the cook who prepares fur-seal steaks and sausage-balls for our delectation
and subsistence. He will fail if he does not:</p>

<p>1. The meat must be perfectly cleaned of every vestige of blubber
or fat, no matter how slight.</p>

<p>2. Cut the flesh then into very thin steaks or slices and soak
them from six to twelve hours in salt and water, a tablespoon of
fine salt to a quart of fresh water. This whitens the meat and removes
the residuum of dark venous blood that will otherwise give
a slightly disagreeable taste, hardly definable, though existing.</p>

<p>3. Fry these steaks, or stew them <em>à la mode</em>, with a few thin slices
of sweet “breakfast” bacon, seasoning with pepper and salt. A rich
brown gravy follows the cooking of the meat. Serve hot, and it is,
strictly judged, a very excellent meat for the daintiest feeder, and
I hereby recommend it confidently as a safe venture for any newcomer
to make.</p>

<p>The flesh of young sea-lions is still better than that of the fur-seal,
while the natives say that the meat of the hair-seal (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phoca
vitulina</i>) is superior to both, being more juicy. Fur-seal meat is
exceedingly dry; hence the necessity of putting bacon into the
frying-pan or stew-pot with it. Sea-lion flesh is an improvement in
this respect, and also that its fat, strange to say, is wholly clear,
white, and inodorous, while the blubber of the “holluschickie” is
sickening to the smell, and will, nine times out of ten, cause any
civilized stomach to throw it up as quickly as it is swallowed.
The natives, however, eat a great deal of it, simply because they
are too lazy to clean their fur-seal cuts and not because they really
relish it.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be well to add that the liver of both
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Callorhinus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias</i> is sweet and wholesome; or, in other
words, it is as good as liver usually is in Fulton Market. The
tongues are small, white, and fat. They are regularly cut out to
some extent and salted in ordinary water-buckets for exportation
to curious friends. They have but slight claim to gastronomic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
favor. The natives are, however, very partial to the liver; but
though they like the tongues, yet they are too lazy to prepare them.
A few of them, in obedience to pressing and prayerful appeals from
relatives at Oonalashka, do exert themselves enough every season
to undergo the extra labor of putting up several barrels of fresh
salted seal-meat, which, being carried down to Illoolook by the
company’s vessels, affords a delightful variation to the steady and
monotonous codfish diet of those Aleutian Islanders.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">[<em>Showing the method of receiving, selecting, kenching and salting “green” fur-seal skins.</em>]</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The final acts of curing and shipping pelts of fur-seals from the
warehouses of the villages, rapidly follow work upon the killing-grounds.
The skins are taken from the field to the salt-house,
where they are laid out, after being again carefully examined, one
upon another, “hair to fat,” like so many sheets of paper, with salt
profusely spread upon the fleshy sides as they are piled up in the
“kenches,” or bins. The salt-house is a large barn-like frame
structure, so built as to afford one-third of its width in the centre,
from end to end, clear and open as a passage-way: while on each
side are rows of stanchions, with sliding planks, which are taken
down and put up in the form of deep bins or boxes—“kenches,”
the sealers call them. As the pile of skins is laid up from the bottom
of an empty “kench” and salt thrown in on the outer edges,
these planks are also put in place, so that the salt may be kept intact
until that bin is filled as high up as a man can toss the skins.
After lying two or three weeks in this style they become “pickled,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
and they are suited then at any time to be taken up and rolled into
bundles of two skins to the package, with the hairy side out, tightly
corded, ready for shipment from the islands.</p>

<p>The average weight of a two-year-old skin is five and one-half
pounds; of a three-year-old skin, seven pounds, and of a four-year-old
skin, twelve pounds, so that, as the major portion of the catch
is two or three year olds, these bundles of two skins each have a
general weight of from twelve to fifteen pounds. In this form
they go into the hold of the company’s steamer at St. Paul, and are
counted out from it in San Francisco. Then they are either at
once shipped to London by the Isthmus of Panama in the same
shape, only packed up in large hogsheads of from twenty to forty
bundles to the package, or expressed by railroad, via New York, to
a similar destination.</p>

<p>The work of bundling the skins is not usually commenced by
the natives until the close of the last week’s sealing; or, in other
words, those skins which they first took, three weeks ago, are now
so pickled by the salt in which they have been lying ever since, as
to render them eligible for this operation and immediate shipment.
The moisture of the air dissolves and destroys a very large quantity
of that saline preservative which the company brings up annually
in the form of rock-salt, principally obtained at Carmen Island,
Lower California.</p>

<p>The Alaska Commercial Company, by the provisions of law
under which they enjoy their franchise, are permitted to take one
hundred thousand male seals annually, and no more, from the
Pribylov Islands. This they do in June and July of every year.
After that season the skins rapidly grow worthless, as the animals
enter into shedding, and, if taken, would not pay for transportation
and the tax.</p>

<p>The bundled skins are carried from the salt-houses to the
beach, when an order for shipment is given, pitched into a bidarrah,
one by one, and rapidly stowed; seven hundred to twelve hundred
bundles make an average single load; then, when alongside the
steamer, they are again tossed up from the lighter and onto her
deck, whence they are stowed in the hold.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span></p>

<p>The method of air-drying which the old settlers employed is
well portrayed by the practice of the natives now, who treat a few
hundred sea-lion skins to that process every fall, preparing them
thus for shipment to Oonalashka, where they are used by brother
Aleutes in covering their bidarkies or kayaks.</p>

<p>The natives, in speaking to me of this matter, said that whenever
the weather was rough and the wind blowing hard, these air-dried
seal-skins, as they were tossed from the bidarrah to the ship’s
deck, numbers of them, would frequently turn in the wind and fly
clean over the vessel into the water beyond, where they were lost.</p>

<p>Under the old order of affairs, prior to the present management,
the skins were packed up and carried on the backs of the
boys and girls, women and old men, to the salt-houses, or drying-frames.
When I first arrived, season of 1872, a slight variation
was made in this respect by breaking a small Siberian bull into
harness and hitching it to a cart, in which the pelts were hauled.
Before the cart was adjusted, however, and the “buik” taught to
pull, it was led out to the killing-grounds by a ring in its nose, and
literally covered with the green seal-hides, which where thus packed
to the kenches. The natives were delighted with even this partial
assistance; but now they have no further concern about it at all, for
several mules and carts render prompt and ample service.</p>

<p>The common or popular notion in regard to seal-skins is, that
they are worn by those animals just as they appear when offered
for sale; that the fur-seal swims about, exposing the same soft coat
with which our ladies of fashion so delight to cover their tender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
forms during inclement winter. This is a very great mistake;
few skins are less attractive than a seal-skin is when it is taken
from the creature. The fur is not visible; it is concealed entirely
by a coat of stiff over-hair, dull, gray-brown, and grizzled. It takes
three of them to make a lady’s sack and boa; and in order that a
reason for their costliness may be apparent, I take great pleasure
in submitting a description of the tedious and skilful labor necessary
to their dressing by the furriers ere they are fit for use:
a leading manufacturer, writing to me, says:—</p>

<p>“When the skins are received by us in the salt, we wash off the
salt, placing them upon a beam somewhat like a tanner’s beam, removing
the fat from the flesh side with a beaming-knife, care being
required that no cuts or uneven places are made in the pelt. The
skins are next washed in water and placed upon the beam with the
fur up, and the grease and water removed by the knife. The skins
are then dried by moderate heat, being tacked out on frames to
keep them smooth. After being fully dried, they are soaked in
water and thoroughly cleansed with soap and water. In some
cases they can be unhaired without this drying process, and
cleansed before drying. After the cleansing process they pass to
the picker, who dries the fur by stove-heat, the pelt being kept
moist. When the fur is dry he places the skin on a beam, and
while it is warm he removes the main coat of hair with a dull shoeknife,
grasping the hair with his thumb and knife, the thumb being
protected by a rubber cob. The hair must be pulled out, not
broken. After a portion is removed the skin must be again warmed
at the stove, the pelt being kept moist. When the outer hairs have
been mostly removed, he uses a beaming-knife to work out the fine
hairs (which are shorter), and the remaining coarser hairs. It will
be seen that great care must be used, as the skin is in that soft
state that too much pressure of the knife would take the fur also;
indeed, bare spots are made. Carelessly cured skins are sometimes
worthless on this account. The skins are next dried, afterward
dampened on the pelt side, and shaved to a fine, even
surface. They are then stretched, worked, and dried, afterward
softened in a fulling-mill, or by treading them with the bare feet in
a hogshead, one head being removed and the cask placed nearly
upright, into which the workman gets with a few skins and some
fine, hardwood sawdust, to absorb the grease while he dances upon
them to break them into leather. If the skins have been shaved thin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
as required when finished, any defective spots or holes must now
be mended, the skin smoothed and pasted with paper on the pelt
side, or two pasted together to protect the pelt in dyeing. The
usual process in the United States is to leave the pelt sufficiently
thick to protect them without pasting.</p>

<p>“In dyeing, the liquid dye is put on with a brush, carefully covering
the points of the standing fur. After lying folded, with the
points touching each other, for some time, the skins are hung up and
dried. The dry dye is then removed, another coat applied, dried,
and removed, and so on, until the required shade is obtained. One
or two of these coats of dye are put on much heavier and pressed
down to the roots of the fur, making what is called the ground.
From eight to twelve coats are required to produce a good color.
The skins are then washed clean, the fur dried, the pelt moist.
They are shaved down to the required thickness, dried, working
them some while drying, then softened in a hogshead, and sometimes
run in a revolving cylinder with fine sawdust to clean them.
The English process does not have the washing after dyeing.”</p>

<p>On account of the fact that all labor in this country, especially
skilled labor, commands so much more per diem in the return of
wages than it does in London or Belgium, it is not practicable for
the Alaska Commercial Company, or any other company here, to
attempt to dress and put upon the market its catch of Bering Sea,
which is in fact the entire catch of the whole world. Our people
understand the theory of dressing these skins perfectly; but they
cannot compete with the cheaper labor of the Old World. Therefore,
nine-tenths, nearly, of the fur-seal skins taken every year are
annually purchased and dressed in London, and from thence
distributed all over the civilized world where furs are worn and
prized.</p>

<p>The great variation in the value of seal-skin sacks, ranging from
seventy-five dollars up to three hundred and fifty dollars, and even
five hundred dollars, is not often due to a variance in the quality
of the fur originally; but it is due to that quality of the work
whereby the fur was treated and prepared for wear. For instance,
cheap sacks are so defectively dyed that a little moisture causes
them to soil the collars and cuffs of their owners, and a little exposure
makes them speedily fade and look ragged. A properly
dyed skin, one that has been conscientiously and laboriously finished
(for it is a labor requiring great patience and great skill), will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
not rub off or “crock” the whitest linen when moistened; and it
will wear the weather, as I have myself seen it on the form of a sea-captain’s
wife, for six and seven successive seasons, without showing
the least bit of dimness or raggedness. I speak of dyeing
alone; I might say the earlier steps of unhairing, in which the over-hair
is deftly combed out and off from the skin, heated to such a
point that the roots of the fur are not loosened, while those to the
coarser hirsute growth are. If this is not done with perfect uniformity,
the fur will never lie smooth, no matter how skilfully dyed;
it will always have a rumpled, ruffled look. Therefore the hastily-dyed
sacks are cheap; and are enhanced in order of value just as
the labor of dyeing is expended upon them.</p>

<p>Another singular and striking characteristic of the Island of St.
Paul, is the fact that this immense slaughtering-field, upon which
seventy-five thousand to ninety thousand fresh carcasses lie every
season, sloughing away into the sand beneath, does not cause any
sickness among the people who live right over them, so to speak.
A cool, raw temperature, and strong winds, peculiar to the place,
seem to prevent any unhealthy effect from that fermentation of decay.
An <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elymus</i> and other grasses once more take heart and
grow with magical vigor over the unsightly spot, to which the sealing-gang
again return, repeating their work upon this place which
we have marked before, three years ago. In that way this strip of
ground, seen on my map between the village, the east landing, and
the lagoon, contains the bones and the oil-drippings and other fragments
thereof, of more than three million seals slain since 1786
thereon, while the slaughter-fields at Novastoshnah record the end
of a million more!</p>

<p>I remember well those unmitigated sensations of disgust which
possessed me when I first landed, April 28, 1872, on the Pribylov
Islands, and passed up from the beach, at Lukannon, to the village
over the killing-grounds; though there was a heavy coat of snow on
the fields, yet each and every one of seventy-five thousand decaying
carcasses was there, and bare, having burned, as it were, their way
out to the open air, polluting the same to a sad degree. I was
laughed at by the residents who noticed my facial contortions, and
assured that this state of smell was nothing to what I should soon
experience when the frost and snow had fairly melted. They were
correct; the odor along by the end of May was terrific punishment
to my olfactories, and continued so for several weeks until my sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
of smell became blunted and callous to such stench by long familiarity.
Like the other old residents I then became quite unconscious
of the prevalence of this rich “funk,” and ceased to notice it.</p>

<p>Those who land here, as I did, for the first time, nervously and
invariably declare that such an atmosphere must breed a plague or
a fever of some kind in the village, and hardly credit the assurance
of those who have resided in it for the whole period of their lives,
that such a thing was never known to St. Paul, and that the island
is remarkably healthy. It is entirely true, however, and, after a
few weeks’ contact, or a couple of months’ experience, at the longest,
the most sensitive nose becomes used to that aroma, wafted as
it is hourly, day in and out, from decaying seal-flesh, viscera, and
blubber; and, also, it ceases to be an object of attention. The
cool, sunless climate during the warmer months has undoubtedly
much to do with checking too rapid decomposition and consequent
trouble therefrom, which would otherwise arise from those killing-grounds.</p>

<p>The freshly-skinned seal bodies of this season do not seem to rot
substantially until the following year; then they rapidly slough
away into the sand upon which they rest; the envelope of blubber
left upon each body seems to act as an air-tight receiver, holding
most of the putrid gases that evolved from the decaying viscera
until their volatile tension causes it to give way; fortunately the
line of least resistance to that merciful retort is usually right where
it is adjacent to the soil, so both putrescent fluids and much of the
stench within is deodorized and absorbed before it can contaminate
the atmosphere to any great extent. The truth of my observation
will be promptly verified, if the sceptic chooses to tear open
any one of the thousands of gas-distended carcasses in the fall, that
were skinned in the killing-season; if he does so, he will be smitten
by the worst smell that human sense can measure; and should he
chance to be accompanied by a native, that callous individual, even,
will pinch his grimy nose and exclaim, it is a “keeshla pahknoot!”</p>

<p>At the close of the third season after skinning, a seal’s body
will have so rotted and sloughed down, as to be marked only by
the bones and a few of the tendinous ligaments; in other words,
it requires from thirty to thirty-six months’ time for such a carcass
to rot entirely away, so that nothing but whitened bones remain
above ground. The natives govern their driving of the seals and
laying out of the fresh bodies according to this fact—they can,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
and do, spread this year a whole season’s killing out over the same
spot of the field previously covered with such fresh carcasses three
summers ago; by alternating with the seasons thus, the natives are
enabled to annually slaughter all of the “holluschickie” on a relatively
small area, close by the salt-houses and the village, as I have
indicated on my map of St. Paul.</p>

<p>The St. Paul village site is located wholly on the northern slope
of the village hill, where it drops from its greatest elevation, at the
flagstaff of one hundred and twenty-five feet, gently down to those
sandy killing-flats below and between it and the main body of the
island. The houses are all placed facing north at regular intervals
along the terraced streets, which run southeast and northwest.
There are seventy-four or eighty native houses, ten large and
smaller buildings of the company, a Treasury agent’s residence,
a church, cemetery crosses, and a school building which are all
standing here in coats of pure white paint. No offal or decaying
refuse of any kind is allowed to rest around the dwellings or lie
in the streets. It required much determined effort on the part of
the whites to effect this sanitary reform; but now most of the natives
take equal pride in keeping their surroundings clean and unpolluted.
The killing-ground of St. Paul is a bottomless sand-flat
only a few feet above high water, and which unites the village hill
and the reef with the island itself. It is not a stone’s throw from
the heart of the settlement; in fact, it is right in town, not even
suburban.</p>

<p>The site of the St. George settlement is more exposed and bleak
than is the one we have just referred to on St. Paul. It is planted
directly on a rounded summit of one of the first low hills that
rise from the sea on the north shore. Indeed, it is the only hill
that does slope directly and gently to the salt water on the island.
Here are twenty-four to thirty native cottages, laid with their doors
facing the opposite sides of a short street between, running also
east and west, as at St. Paul. There, however, each house looks
down upon the rear of its neighbor in front and below—here the
houses face each other on the top of the hill. The Treasury agent’s
quarters, the company’s six or seven buildings, the school-house, and
the church, are all neatly painted: therefore this settlement, by its
prominent position, shows from the sea to a much better advantage
than the larger one of St. Paul does. The same municipal sanitary
regulations are enforced here. Those who may visit the St. George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
and St. Paul of to-day will find their streets dry and hard as floors
for they have been covered with a thick layer of volcanic cinders
on both islands.</p>

<p>On St. George the “holluschickie” are regularly driven to that
northeast slope of the village hill which drops down gently to the
sea, where they are slaughtered, close by and under the houses, as
at St Paul. Those droves which are brought in from the North
rookery to the west, and also Starry Arteel, are frequently driven
right through the village itself. This killing-field of St. George
is hard tufa and rocky, but it slopes away to the ocean rapidly
enough to drain itself well; hence the constant rain and humid
fogs of summer carry off that which would soon clog and deprive
the natives from using the ground year after year in rotation, as
they do. Several seasons have occurred, however, when this natural
cleansing of the place, above mentioned, has not been as thorough
as must be, so as to be used again immediately: then the seals
were skinned back of the village hill and in that ravine to the westward
on the same slope from its summit.</p>

<p>This village site of St. George to-day, and the killing-grounds
adjoining, used to be, during early Russian occupation, in Pribylov’s
time, a large sea-lion rookery, the finest one known to either
island, St. Paul or St. George. Natives are living now, who told
me that their fathers had been employed in shooting and driving
these sea-lions, so as to deliberately break up a breeding-ground,
and thus rid the island of what they considered a superabundant
supply of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias</i>, and thereby to aid and encourage a
fresh and increased accession of fur-seals from the vast majority peculiar
to St. Paul, which could not ensue while big sea-lions held
the land.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_107" href="#FNanchor_107" class="label">[107]</a> The seal-life on the Pribylov Islands may be classified under the following
heads, namely: (1) The fur-seal, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cattorhinus ursinus</i>, the “kautickie” of
the Russians; (2) the sea-lion, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias stelleri</i>, the “seevitchie” of the Russians;
(3) the hair-seal, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phoca vitulina</i>, the “nearhpahsky” of the Russians;
(4) the walrus, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Odobænus obesus</i>, the “morsjee” of the Russians.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_108" href="#FNanchor_108" class="label">[108]</a> The inconsequential numbers of the hair-seal around and on the Pribylov
Islands seem to be characteristic of all Alaskan waters and the northwest
coast; also, the phocidæ are equally scant on the Asiatic littoral margins.
Only the following four species are known to exist throughout the entire extent
of that vast marine area, viz.:</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phoca vitulina</i>—Everywhere between Bering Straits and California.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phoca fœtida</i>—Plover Bay, Norton’s Sound, Kuskokvim mouth, and Bristol
Bay, of Bering Sea; Cape Seartze Kammin, Arctic Ocean, to Point Barrow.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erignathus barbatus</i>—Kamchatkan coast, Norton’s Sound, Kuskokvim
mouth and Bristol Bay, of Bering Sea.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Histriophoca equestris</i>—Yukon mouth and coast south to Bristol Bay, of
Bering Sea.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_109" href="#FNanchor_109" class="label">[109]</a> Those extremely heavy adult males which arrive first in the season and
take their stations on the rookeries, are so fat that they do not exhibit a
wrinkle or a fold of the skins enveloping their blubber-lined bodies. Most of
this fatty deposit is found around the shoulders and the neck, though a warm
coat of blubber covers all the other portions of the body save the flippers. This
blubber-thickening of the neck and chest is characteristic of the adult males
only, which are, by its provisions, enabled to sustain the extraordinary protracted
fasting periods incident to their habit of life and reproduction.</p>

<p>When those superlatively fleshy bulls first arrive, a curious body-tremor
seems to attend every movement which the animals make on land; their fat
appears to ripple backward and forward under their hides, like waves. As
they alternate with their flippers in walking, the whole form of the “see-catchie”
fairly shakes as a bowl full of jelly does when agitated on the table
before us.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_110" href="#FNanchor_110" class="label">[110]</a> The distances at sea, away from the Pribylov Islands, in which fur-seals
are found during the breeding season, are very considerable. Scattered records
have been made of seeing large bands of them during August as far down
the northwest coast as they probably range at any season of the year, viz., well
out at sea in the latitude of Cape Flattery, 47° to 49° south latitude. In the
winter and spring, up to middle of June, all classes are found here spread out
over wide areas of ocean. Then by June 15th they will have all departed, the
first and the latest, <em>en route</em> for the Pribylov Islands. Then, when seen again
in this extreme southern range, I presume the unusually early examples of
return toward the end of August are squads of the yearlings of both sexes, for
this division is always the last to land on and the first to leave the Seal Islands
annually.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_111" href="#FNanchor_111" class="label">[111]</a> “See-catch,” is the native name for a bull on the rookeries, especially
one which is able to maintain its position.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_112" href="#FNanchor_112" class="label">[112]</a> “Hauling up,” is a technical term applied to the action of seals when
they land from the surf and haul up or drag themselves over the beach. It
is expressive and appropriate, as are most of the sealing phrases.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_113" href="#FNanchor_113" class="label">[113]</a> There is also perfect uniformity in the coloration of the breeding coats
of fur-seals, which is strikingly manifest while inspecting the rookeries
late in July, when they are solidly massed thereon. At a quarter-mile distance
the whole immense aggregate of animal life seems to be fused into a
huge homogeneous body that is alternately roused up in sections and then
composed, just as a quantity of iron-filings covering the bottom of a saucer
will rise and fall when a magnet is passed over and around the dish.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_114" href="#FNanchor_114" class="label">[114]</a> Without explanation I may be considered as making use of paradoxical
language by using these terms of description, since the inconsistency of talking
of “pups,” with “cows,” and “bulls,” and “rookeries,” on the breeding
grounds of the same, cannot fail to be noticed; but this nomenclature has
been given and used by the American and English whaling and sealing parties
for many years, and the characteristic features of the seals themselves so suit
the naming that I have felt satisfied to retain the style throughout as rendering
my description more intelligible, especially so to those who are engaged in
the business or may be hereafter. The Russians are more consistent, but not
so “pat.” They call the bull “see-catch,” a term implying strength, vigor,
etc.; the cow, “matkah,” or mother; the pups, “kotickie,” or little seals;
the non-breeding males under six and seven years, “holluschickie,” or bachelors.
The name applied collectively to the fur-seal by them is “morskie-kot,”
or sea-cat.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_115" href="#FNanchor_115" class="label">[115]</a> Dr. Otto Cramer: The suddenness with which fog and wind shut down and
sweep over the sea here, even when the day opens most auspiciously for a short
boat-voyage, has so alarmed the natives in times past that a visit is now never
made by them from island to island, unless on one of the company’s vessels
Several bidarrahs have never been heard from, which, in earlier times, attempted
to sail, with picked crews of the natives, from one island to the other.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_116" href="#FNanchor_116" class="label">[116]</a> “Do these seals drink?” is a question doubtless often uppermost and
suggested to the observer’s eye, as he watches those animals going to the water
from the hauling-grounds and the rookeries; at least it was in mine. I never
could detect a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">callorhinus</i> or a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eumetopias</i> lapping, either in the fresh-water pools
and lakes, or in the brackish lagoon, or the sea; but it plunges at times into
the rollers with its jaws wide open as it dives, reappearing quickly in the same
manner to dip and rise again, many times in rapid succession, as it swims
along, the water running in little streams from the corners of the open mouth
whenever its head pops above the surface. Whether this action was simply
to cool itself, or that of drinking, I am not prepared to assert positively. I
think it was to meet both purposes.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_117" href="#FNanchor_117" class="label">[117]</a> The old males, when grouped together by themselves, indulge in no
humor or frolicsome festivities whatsoever. On the contrary, they treat each
other with surly indifference. The mature females, however, do not appear
to lose their good nature to anything like so marked a degree as do their lords
and masters, for they will at all seasons of their presence on the islands be observed,
now and then, to suddenly unbend from severe matronly gravity by
coyly and amiably tickling and gently teasing one another, as they rest in the
harems, or later, when strolling in September. There is no sign given, however,
by these seal-mothers of a desire or attempt to fondle or caress their
pups; nor do the young appear to sport with any others than the pups themselves,
when together. Sometimes a yearling and a five or six months old pup
will have a long-continued game between themselves. They are decidedly
clannish in this respect—creatures of caste, like Hindoos.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_118" href="#FNanchor_118" class="label">[118]</a> When the females first come ashore there is no sign whatever of affection
manifested between the sexes. The males are surly and morose, and
the females entirely indifferent to such reception. They are, however, subjected
to very harsh treatment sometimes in progress of battles between the
males for their possession, and a few of them are badly bitten and lacerated
every season.</p>

<p>One of the cows that arrived at Nahspeel, St. Paul’s Island, early in June,
1872, was treated to a mutilation in this manner, under my eyes. When she
had finally landed on the barren rocks of one of the numerous “see-catchie”
at the water-front of this small rookery, and while I was carefully making a
sketch of her graceful outlines, a rival bull, adjacent, reached out from his
station and seized her with his mouth at the nape of the neck, just as a cat
lifts a kitten. At the same instant, almost simultaneously, the old male that
was rightfully entitled to her charms, turned, and caught her in his teeth by
the skin of her posterior dorsal region. There she was, lifted and suspended
in mid-air, between the jaws of the furious rivals, until, in obedience to their
powerful struggles, the hide of her back gave way, and, as a ragged flap
of the raw skin more than six inches broad and a foot in length was torn
up and from her spine, she passed, with a rush, into the possession of the bull
which had covetously seized her. She uttered no cry during this barbarous
treatment, nor did she, when settled again, turn to her torn and bleeding
wound to notice it in any way whatsoever that I could observe.</p>

<p>I may add here that I never saw the seals under such, or any circumstances,
lick or nurse their wounds as dogs or cats do; but, when severe inflammation
takes place, they seek the water, disappearing promptly from scrutiny.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_119" href="#FNanchor_119" class="label">[119]</a> This old Aleut, Philip Vollkov, passed to his final rest—“un konchielsah”—in
the winter of 1878-79. He was one of the real characters of
St. Paul. He was esteemed by the whites on account of his relative intelligence,
and beloved by the natives, who called him their “wise man,” and
who exulted in his piety. Philip, like the other people there of his kind,
was not much comfort to me when I asked questions as to the seals. He
usually answered important inquiries by crossing himself and replying, “God
knows.” There was no appeal from this.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_120" href="#FNanchor_120" class="label">[120]</a> The only danger which these little fellows are subject to up here is being
caught by an October gale down at the surf-margin, when they have not
fairly learned to swim. Large numbers have been destroyed by sudden “nips”
of this character.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_121" href="#FNanchor_121" class="label">[121]</a> The fur-seal spends a great deal of time, both at sea and on land, in
scratching its hide; for it is annoyed by a species of louse, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pediculus</i>, to just
about the same degree and in the same manner that our dogs are by fleas. To
scratch, it sits upon its haunches, and scrapes away with the toe-nails of first
one and then the other of its hind flippers, by which action it reaches readily
all portions of its head, neck, chest and shoulders, and with either one or the
other of its fore flippers it rubs down its spinal region back of the shoulders to
the tail. By that division of labor with its feet it can promptly reduce, with
every sign of comfort, any lousy irritation wheresoever on its body. This
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pediculus</i> peculiar to the fur-seal attaches itself almost exclusively to the pectoral
regions; a few also are generally found at the bases of the auricular
pavilions.</p>

<p>When the fur-seal is engaged in this exercise it cocks its head and wears
exactly the same expression that our common house-dog does while subjugating
and eradicating fleas; the eyes are partly or wholly closed; the tongue
lolls out; and the whole demeanor is one of quiet but intense satisfaction.</p>

<p>The fur-seal appears also to scratch itself in the water with the same facility
and unction so marked on land, only it varies the action by using its fore-hands
principally in its pelagic exercise, while its hind-feet do most of the
terrestrial scraping.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_122" href="#FNanchor_122" class="label">[122]</a> It has been suggested to me that the exquisite power of scent possessed
by these animals enables them to reach the breeding grounds at about the place
where they left them the season previously: surely the nose of the fur-seal is
endowed to a superlative degree with those organs of smell, and its range of
appreciation in this respect must be very great.</p>

<p>I noticed in all sleeping and waking seals that the nasal apertures were
never widely expanded; and that they were at intervals rapidly opened and
closed with inhalation and exhalation of each breath; the nostrils of the fur-seal
are, as a rule, well opened when the animal is out of water, and remain
so while it is on land.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_123" href="#FNanchor_123" class="label">[123]</a> The Russian term “holluschickie” or “bachelors” is very appropriate,
and is usually employed.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_124" href="#FNanchor_124" class="label">[124]</a> If there is any one faculty better developed than the others in the brain
of the intelligent <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Callorhinus</i>, it must be its “bump” of locality. The unerring
directness with which it pilots its annual course back through thousands
of miles of watery waste to these spots of its birth—small fly-dots of land in
the map of Bering Sea and the North Pacific—is a very remarkable exhibition
of its skill in navigation. While the Russians were established at Bodega
and Ross, Cal., seventy years ago, they frequently shot fur-seals at sea when
hunting the sea-otter off the coast between Fuca Straits and the Farallones.
Many of these animals, late in May and early in June, were so far advanced in
pregnancy that it was deemed certain by their captors that some shore must
be close at hand upon which the near-impending birth of the pup took place.
Thereupon the Russians searched over every rod of the coast-line of the mainland
and the archipelago between California and the peninsula of Alaska,
vainly seeking everywhere there for a fur-seal rookery. They were slow to
understand how animals so close to the throes of parturition could strike out
into the broad ocean to swim fifteen hundred or two thousand miles within a
week or ten days ere they landed on the Pribylov group, and, almost immediately
after, give birth to their offspring.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_125" href="#FNanchor_125" class="label">[125]</a> I did not permit myself to fall into error by estimating this matter of
weight, because I early found that the apparent huge bulk of a sea-lion bull or
fur-seal male, when placed upon the scales, shrank far below my notions: I took
a great deal of pains, on several occasions, during the killing-season, to have a
platform scale carted out into the field, and as the seals were knocked down,
and before they were bled, I had them carefully weighed, constructing the following
table from my observations:</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_126" href="#FNanchor_126" class="label">[126]</a> Veniaminov: Zapieskie ob Oonalashkenskaho Otdayla, 2 vols., St. Petersburg,
1842. This work of Bishop Innocent Veniaminov is the only one
which the Russians can lay claim to as exhibiting anything like a history of
Western Alaska, or of giving a sketch of its inhabitants and resources, that
has the least merit of truth or the faintest stamp of reliability. Without it we
should be simply in the dark as to much of what the Russians were about during
the whole period of their occupation and possession of that country. He
served, chiefly as a priest and missionary, for nineteen years, from 1823 to
1842, mainly at Oonalashka, having the Seal Islands in his parish, and was
made Bishop of all Alaska. He was soon after recalled to Russia, where he
became the primate of the national church, ranking second to no man in the
Empire save the Czar. He was advanced in life, being more than ninety
years of age when he died at Moscow, April 22, 1879. He must have been
a man of fine personal presence, judging from the following description of
him, noted by Sir George Simpson, who met him at Sitka in 1842, just as he
was about to embark for Russia: “His appearance, to which I have already
alluded, impresses a stranger with something of awe, while in further intercourse
the gentleness which characterizes his every word and deed insensibly
moulds reverence into love, and at the same time his talents and attainments
are such as to be worthy of his exalted station. With all this, the bishop is
sufficiently a man of the world to disdain anything like cant. His conversation,
on the contrary, teems with amusement and instruction, and his company
is much prized by all who have the honor of his acquaintance.” Sir
Edward Belcher, who saw him at Kadiak in 1837, said: “He is a formidable-looking
man, over six feet three inches in his boots, and athletic. He impresses
one profoundly.”</p>

titles on my map that indicate the several breeding-grounds, owe their
origin and have their meaning as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zapadnie</span> signifies “<em>westward</em>,” and is so used by the people who live in
the village.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zoltoi</span> signifies “<em>golden</em>,” so used to express a metallic shimmering of the
sand there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ketavie</span> signifies “<em>of a whale</em>” so used to designate that point where a
large right whale was stranded in 1849 (?); from Russian “<em>keet</em>,” or “<em>whale</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lukannon</span>—so named after one Lukannon, a pioneer Russian, that distinguished
himself, with one Kaiecov, a countryman, who captured a large
number of sea-otters at that point, and on Otter Island, in 1787-88.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tonkie Mees</span> signifies “<em>small</em> (or “<em>slender</em>”) <em>cape</em>” [tonkie, “thin”;
mees, “cape”].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polavina</span> literally signifies “<em>half way</em>” so used by the natives because it
is practically half way between the salt-houses at Northeast Point and the village.
<span class="smcap">Polavina Sopka</span>, or “<em>half-way mountain</em>,” gets its name in the same
manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Novastoshnah</span>, from the Russian “<em>novaite</em>,” or “<em>of recent growth</em>,” so
used because this locality in pioneer days was an island to itself; and it has
been annexed recently to the mainland of St. Paul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vesolia Mista</span>, or “<em>jolly place</em>,” the site of one of the first settlements,
and where much carousing was indulged in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maroonitch</span>, the site of a pioneer village, established by one Maroon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nahsayvernia</span>, or “<em>on the north shore</em>” from Russian, “<em>sayvernie</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bogaslov</span>, or “<em>word of God</em>,” indefinite in its application to the place, but
is, perhaps, due to the fact that the pious Russians, immediately after landing
at Zapadnie, in 1787, ascended the hill and erected a huge cross thereon.
<span class="smcap">Einahnuhto</span>, an Aleutian word, signifying the “<em>three mammæ</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tolstoi</span>, a Russian name, signifying “<em>thick</em>”; it is given to at least a hundred
different capes and headlands throughout Alaska, being applied as indiscriminately
as we do the term “Bear Creek” to little streams in our Western
States and Territories.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_128" href="#FNanchor_128" class="label">[128]</a> One of the natives, “stareek,” Zachar Oostigov, told me that the “Russians,
when they first landed, came ashore in a thick fog” at Tolstoi Mees,
near the present sea-lion rookery site. As the water is deep and “bold” there,
Pribylov’s sloop, the <em>St. George</em>, must have jammed her bowsprit against those
lofty cliffs ere the patient crew had intimation of their position. The old
Aleut then showed me that steep gully there, up which the ardent discoverers
climbed to a plateau above: and, to demonstrate that he was not chilled or
weakened by age, he nimbly scrambled down to the surf below, some three
hundred and fifty vertical feet, and I followed, half stepping and half sliding
over Pribylov’s path of glad discovery and proud possession, trodden one June
day by him nearly a hundred years ago.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_129" href="#FNanchor_129" class="label">[129]</a> The thought of what a deadly epidemic would effect among these vast
congregations of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinnipedia</i> was one that was constant in my mind when on
the ground and among them. I have found in the “British Annals” (Fleming’s),
on page 17, an extract from the notes of Dr. Trail: “In 1833 I inquired
for my old acquaintances, the seals of the Hole of Papa Westray, and was
informed that about four years before they had totally deserted the island, and
had only within the last few months begun to reappear.... About fifty
years ago multitudes of their carcasses were cast ashore in every bay in the
north of Scotland, Orkney, and Shetland, and numbers were found at sea in
a sickly state.” This note of Trail is the only record which I can find of a
fatal epidemic among seals. It is not reasonable to suppose that the Pribylov
rookeries have never suffered from distempers in the past, or are not to in
the future, simply because no occasion seems to have arisen during the comparatively
brief period of their human domination.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_130" href="#FNanchor_130" class="label">[130]</a> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Somniosus microcephalus.</i> Some of these sharks are of very large size,
and when caught by the Indians of the northwest coast, basking or asleep on
the surface of the sea, they will, if transfixed by the natives’ harpoons, take
a whole fleet of canoes in tow and run swiftly with them several hours before
exhaustion enables the savages to finally despatch them. A Hudson Bay
trader, William Manson (at Fort Alexander in 1865), told me that his father
had killed one in the smooth waters of Millbank Sound which measured
twenty-four feet in length, and its liver alone yielded thirty-six gallons of oil.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Somniosus</i> lies motionless for long intervals in calm waters of the North
Pacific, just under and at the surface, with its dorsal fin clearly exposed above.
What havoc such a carnivorous fish would be likely to effect in a “pod” of
young fur-seals can be better imagined than described.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_131" href="#FNanchor_131" class="label">[131]</a> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orca gladiator.</i> While revolving this particular line of inquiry in my
mind when on the ground and among the seals, I involuntarily looked constantly
for some sign of disturbance in the sea which would indicate the presence
of an enemy, and, save seeing a few examples of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orca</i>, I never detected
anything. If the killer-whale was common here, it would be patent to
the most casual eye, because it is the habit of this ferocious cetacean to swim
so closely at the surface as to show its peculiar sharp dorsal fin high above the
water. Possibly a very superficial observer could and would confound that
long trenchant fluke of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orca</i> with the stubby node upon the spine of a
humpback whale, which that animal exhibits only when it is about to dive.
Humpbacks feed around the islands, but not commonly; they are the exception.
They do not, however, molest the seals in any manner whatever, and
little squads of these pinnipeds seem to delight themselves by swimming in
endless circles around and under the huge bodies of those whales, frequently
leaping out and entirely over the cetacean’s back, as witnessed on one occasion
by myself and the crew of the <em>Reliance</em> off the coast of Kadiak, June, 1874.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132" class="label">[132]</a> I feel confident that I have placed this average of fish eaten per diem by
each seal at a starvation allowance, or, in other words, it is a certain minimum
of the whole consumption. If the seals can get double the quantity which I
credit them with above, startling as it seems, still I firmly believe that they eat
it every year. An adequate realization by icthyologists and fishermen as to
what havoc the fur-seal hosts are annually making among the cod, herring,
and salmon of the northwest coast and Alaska, would disconcert and astonish
them. Happily for the peace of political economists who may turn their attention
to the settlement and growth of the Pacific coast of America, it bids
fair to never be known with anything like precision. The fishing of man,
both aboriginal and civilized, in the past, present, and prospective, has never
been, is not, nor will it be, more than a drop in the bucket contrasted with those
piscatorial labors of these icthyophagi in the waters adjacent to their birth.
What catholic knowledge of fish and fishing-banks any one of those old
“seecatchie” must possess, which we observe hauled out on the Pribylov
rookeries each summer! It has, undoubtedly, during the eighteen or twenty
years of its life, explored every fish-eddy, bank, or shoal throughout the
whole of that vast immensity of the North Pacific and Bering Sea. It has had
more piscine sport in a single twelvemonth than Izaak Walton had in his
whole life.</p>

<p>An old sea-captain, Dampier, cruising around the world just about two
hundred years ago, wrote diligently thereof (or, rather, one Funnel is said to
have written for him), and wrote well. He had frequent reference to meeting
hair-seals and sea-lions, fur-seals, etc., and fell into repeating this maxim, evidently
of his own making: “For wherever there be plenty of fysh, there be
seals.” I am sure that, unless a vast abundance of good fishing-ground was
near by, no such congregation of seal-life as is that under discussion on the
Seal Islands could exist. The whole eastern half of Bering Sea, in its entirety,
is a single fish-spawning bank, nowhere deeper than fifty to seventy-five
fathoms, averaging, perhaps, forty; also, there are great reaches of fishing-shoals
up and down the northwest coast, from and above the Straits of Fuca,
bordering the entire southern, or Pacific coast, of the Aleutian Islands. The
aggregate of cod, herring, and salmon which the seals find upon these vast
icthyological areas of reproduction, must be simply enormous, and fully equal
to a most extravagant demand of the voracious appetites of <em>Callorhini</em>.</p>

<p>When, however, the fish retire from spawning here, there, and everywhere
over these shallows of Alaska and the northwest coast, along by the end of
September to the 1st of November, every year, I believe that the young fur-seal,
in following them into the depths of the great Pacific, must have a really
arduous struggle for existence—unless it knows of fishing-banks unknown to
us. The yearlings, however, and all above that age, are endowed with sufficient
muscular energy to dive rapidly in deep soundings, and to fish with undoubted
success. The pup, however, when it goes to sea, five or six months
old, is not lithe and sinewy like the yearling; it is podgy and fat, a comparatively
clumsy swimmer, and does not develop, I believe, into a good fisherman
until it has become pretty well starved after leaving the Pribylovs.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_133" href="#FNanchor_133" class="label">[133]</a> I heard a great deal of talk among the white residents of St. Paul, when I
first landed and the sealing-season opened, about the necessity of “resting” the
hauling-grounds; in other words, they said if the seals were driven in repeated
daily rotation from any one of the hauling-grounds, that this would so
disturb these animals as to prevent their coming to any extent again thereon,
during the rest of the season. This theory seemed rational enough to me at
the beginning of my investigations, and I was not disposed to question its
accuracy; but subsequent observation directed to this point particularly satisfied
me, and the sealers themselves with whom I was associated, that the driving
of the seals had no effect whatever upon the hauling which took place
soon or immediately after the field, for the hour, had been swept clean of seals
by the drivers. If the weather was favorable for landing, <em>i. e.</em>, cool, moist,
and foggy, the fresh hauling of the “holluschickie” would cover the bare
grounds again in a very short space of time: sometimes in a few hours after the
driving of every seal from Zoltoi sands over to the killing-fields adjacent, those
dunes and the beach in question would be swarming anew with fresh arrivals.
If, however, the weather is abnormally warm and sunny, during its prevalence,
even if for several consecutive days, no seals to speak of will haul out on the
emptied space; indeed, if these “holluschickie” had not been taken away by
man from Zoltoi or any other hauling-ground on the islands when “tayopli”
weather prevailed, most of those seals would have vacated their terrestrial
loafing-places for the cooler embraces of the sea.</p>

<p>The importance of clearly understanding this fact as to the readiness of
the “holluschickie” to haul promptly out on steadily “swept” ground, provided
the weather is inviting, is very great; because, when not understood, it
was deemed necessary, even as late as the season of 1872, to “rest” the
hauling-grounds near the village (from which all the driving has been
made since), and make trips to far-away Polavina and distant Zapadnie—an
unnecessary expenditure of human time, and a causeless infliction of physical
misery upon phocine backs and flippers.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_134" href="#FNanchor_134" class="label">[134]</a> The fur-seal, like all of the pinnipeds, has no sweat-glands; hence, when
it is heated, it cools off by the same process of panting which is so characteristic
of the dog, accompanied by the fanning that I have hitherto fully described;
the heavy breathing and low grunting of a tired drove of seals, on a
warmer day than usual, can be heard several hundred yards away. It is surprising
how quickly the hair and fur will come out of the skin of a blood-heated
seal—literally rubs bodily off at a touch of the finger. A fine specimen
of a three-year-old “holluschak” fell in its tracks at the head of the
lagoon while being driven to the village killing-grounds. I asked that it be
skinned with special reference to mounting; accordingly a native was sent for,
who was on the spot, knife in hand, within less than thirty minutes from the
moment that this seal fell in the road, yet soon after he had got fairly to work
patches of the fur and hair came off here and there wherever he chanced to
clutch the skin.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_135" href="#FNanchor_135" class="label">[135]</a> When turning the stunned and senseless carcasses, the only physical danger
of which the sealers run the slightest risk, during the whole circuit of
their work, occurs thus: at this moment the prone and quivering body of the
“holluschak” is not wholly inert, perhaps, though it is nine times out of ten;
and as the native takes hold of a fore flipper to jerk the carcass over on to its
back, the half-brained seal rouses, snaps suddenly and viciously, often biting
the hands or legs of unwary skinners: they then come leisurely and unconcernedly
up into the surgeon’s office at the village, for bandages, etc. A few
men are bitten every day or two daring the season on the islands, in this manner,
but I have never learned of any serious result following any case.</p>

<p>The sealers, as might be expected, become exceedingly expert in keeping
their knives sharp, putting edges on them as keen as razors, and in an instant
detect any dulness by passing the balls of their thumbs over the suspected
edges to such blades.</p>

<p>The white sealers of the Antarctic always used an orthodox butcher’s
“steel” in sharpening their knives, but these natives never have, and probably
never will abandon those little whetstones above referred to.</p>

<p>During the Russian management, and throughout the strife in killing by
our own people in 1868, a very large number of the skins were cut through,
here and there, by the slipping of the natives’ knives, when they were taking
them from the carcasses, and “flensing” them from the superabundance, in
spots, of blubber. These knife-cuts through the skin, no matter how slight,
give great annoyance to the dresser, hence they are always marked down in
price. The prompt scrutiny of each skin on the islands by an agent of the
Alaska Commercial Company, who rejects every one of them thus injured, has
caused the natives to exercise greater care, and the number now so damaged,
every season, is absolutely trifling.</p>

<p>Another source of small loss is due to a habit which the “holluschickie”
have of occasionally biting each other when they are being urged along in
the drives, and thus crowded once in a while one upon the other. Usually
these examples of “zoobäden” are detected by the natives prior to the
“knocking down,” and spared; yet those which have been nipped on the
chest or abdomen cannot be thus noticed, and, until the skin is lifted, the
damage is not apprehended.</p>

<p>The aim and force with which the native directs his blow determines the
death of a fur-seal. If struck direct and violently, a single stroke is enough.
The seals’ heads are stricken so hard sometimes that those crystalline lenses to
their eyes fly out from the orbital sockets like hail-stones, or little pebbles, and
frequently struck me sharply in the face, or elsewhere, while I stood near by
watching a killing-gang at work.</p>

<p>A singular lurid green light suddenly suffuses the eye of a fur-seal at
intervals when it is very much excited; as the “podding” for the clubbers
is in progress and at the moment when last raising its head it sees the uplifted
bludgeons on every hand above, fear seems then for the first time to possess it
and to instantly gild its eye in this strange manner. When the seal is brained
in this state of optical coloration I have noticed that the opalescent tinting remained
well defined for many hours or a whole day after death. These remarkable
flashes are very characteristic to the eyes of the old males during
their hurly-burly on the rookeries, but never appear in the younger classes
unless as just described, as far as I could observe.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_136" href="#FNanchor_136" class="label">[136]</a> The shallow depths of Bering Sea give rise to a very bad surf, and though
none of the natives can swim, as far as I could learn, yet they are quite
creditable surfmen, and work the heavy “baidar” in and out from the landing
adroitly and circumspectly. They put a sentinel upon the bluffs over Nah
Speel, and go and come between the rollers as he signals. They are not graceful
oarsmen under any circumstances, but can pull heartily and coolly together
when in a pinch. The apparent ease and unconcern with which they handled
their bidarrah here in the “baroon” during the fall of 1869 so emboldened
three or four sailors of the United States Revenue Marine cutter <em>Lincoln</em> that
they lost their lives in such surf through sheer carelessness. The “gig”
in which they were coming ashore “broached to” in the breakers just outside
the cove, and their lifeless forms were soon after thrown up by merciless
waves on the Lagoon rookery. Three graves of these men are plainly marked
on a western slope of the Black Bluffs.</p>

<p>There is a false air of listlessness and gentleness about an open sea, or roadstead
roller, that is very apt to deceive even watermen of good understanding.
The crushing, overwhelming power with which an ordinary breaker will hurl
a large ship’s boat on rocks awash, must be personally experienced ere it is
half appreciated.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The sea-lion is also a characteristic pinniped of the Pribylov Islands,
but ranks much below the fur-seal in perfected physical organization
and intelligence. It can, as well as its more sagacious and
valuable relative, the <em>Callorhinus</em>, be seen, perhaps, to better advantage
on these islands than elsewhere in the whole world that I know
of. The marked difference between a sea-lion and the fur-seal up
here is striking, the former being twice the size of its cousin.</p>

<p>The size and strength of a northern sea-lion, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias stelleri</i>,
its perfect adaptation to its physical surroundings, unite with
a singular climatic elasticity of organization. It seems to be equally
well satisfied with the ice-floes of the Kamchatka Sea to the northward,
or with the polished boulders and the hot sands of the coast
of California. It is an animal as it appears upon its accustomed
breeding grounds at Northeast Point, where I first saw it, that commanded
my involuntary admiration by its imposing presence and
sonorous voice, as it reared itself before me, with head, neck, and
chest upon its powerful forearms, over six feet in height, while its
heavy bass voice drowned the booming of the surf that thundered
on the rocks beneath its flanks.</p>

<p>The bulk and power of the adult sea-lion male will be better
appreciated when I say that it has an average length of ten and
eleven feet osteologically, with an enormous girth of eight to nine
feet around the chest and shoulders; but while the anterior parts
of its frame are as perfect and powerful on land as in sea, those
posterior are ridiculously impotent when the huge beast leaves its
favorite element. Still, when hauled up beyond the reach of the
brawling surf, as it rears itself, shaking the spray from its tawny
chest and short grizzly mane, it has a leonine appearance and bearing,
greatly enhanced as the season advances by a rich golden-rufous
color of its coat; the savage gleam of its expression is due
probably, to the sinister muzzle, and cast of its eye. This optical
organ is not round and full, soft and limpid, like the fur-seal’s, but
it is an eye like that of a bull-dog: it is small and clearly shows
under its heavy lids the white or sclerotic coat, with a light-brown
iris. Its teeth gleam and glisten in pearly whiteness against a dark
tongue and the shadowy recesses of its wide, deep mouth. The
long, sharp, broad-based canines, when bared by the wrathful
snarling of its gristled lips, glittered more wickedly, to my eye,
than the keenest sword ever did in the hand of man.</p>

<p>With these teeth alone, backed by the enormous muscular power
of a mighty neck and broad shoulders, the sea-lion confines its battles
to its kind, spurred by terrible energy and heedless and persistent
brute courage. No animals that I have ever seen in combat presented
a more savage or more cruelly fascinating sight than did a
brace of old sea-lion bulls which met under my eyes near the Garden
Cove at St. George.</p>

<p>Here was a sea-lion rookery the outskirts of which I had trodden
upon for the first time. Two aged males, surrounded by their
meek, polygamous families, were impelled towards each other by
those latent fires of hate and jealousy which seemed to burst forth
and fairly consume the angry rivals. Opening with a long, round,
vocal prelude, they gradually came together, as the fur-seal bulls
do, with averted heads, as though the sight of each other was sickening—but
fight they must. One would play against the other for
an unguarded moment in which to assume the initiative, until it
had struck its fangs into the thick skin of its opponent’s jowl;
then, clinching its jaws, was not shaken off until the struggles of
its tortured victim literally tore them out, leaving an ugly, gaping
wound—for the sharp eye-teeth cut a deeper gutter in the skin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
flesh than would have held my hand; fired into almost supernatural
rage, the injured lion retaliated, quick as a flash, in kind; the hair
flew from both of them into the air, the blood streamed down in
frothy torrents, while high above the boom of the breaking waves,
and shrill deafening screams of water-fowl over head, rose the
ferocious, hoarse, and desperate roar of these combatants.</p>

<p>Though provided with flippers, to all external view, as the fur-seal
is, the sea-lion cannot, however, make use of them at all in the
same free manner. The fur-seal may be driven five or six miles in
twenty-four hours under the most favorable conditions of cool, moist
weather; the “seevitchie,” however, can only go two miles, the
weather and roadway being the same. When driven, a sea-lion balances
and swings its long and heavy neck, as a lever, to and fro,
with every hitching up behind of its posterior limbs, which it seldom
raises from the ground, drawing them up after the fore-feet
with a sliding drag over the grass or sand and rocks, as the case
may be, ever and anon pausing to take a sullen and savage survey
of the field and the natives who are urging it.</p>

<p>The sea-lion is polygamous, but it does not maintain any regular
system and method in preparing for and attending to its harem,
like that so finely illustrated on the breeding-grounds of the fur-seal;
and it is not so numerous, comparatively speaking. There
are not, according to my best judgment, over ten or twelve thousand
of these animals altogether on the breeding-grounds of the
Pribylov Islands. It does not haul more than a few rods anywhere
or under any circumstances back from the sea. It cannot be visited
and inspected by men as the fur-seals are, for it is so shy and suspicious
that on the slightest warning of such an approach, a stampede
into the water is sure to result.</p>

<p>That noteworthy, intelligent courage of a fur-seal, though it
does not possess half the size nor one-quarter of the muscular
strength of a sea-lion, is entirely wanting in the huge bulk and
brain of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias</i>. A boy with a rattle or a pop-gun could
stampede ten thousand sea-lion bulls in the height of a breeding-season
to the water, and keep them there for the rest of the time.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span></p>

<p>Old males come out and locate themselves over the narrow belts
of rookery-grounds (sometimes, as at St. Paul, on the immediate
sea-margin of fur-seal breeding-places), two or three weeks in advance
of the females, which arrive later, <em>i.e.</em>, between the 1st to the
6th of June; and these females are never subjected to that intense,
jealous supervision so characteristic of the fur-seal harem. Big
sea-lion bulls, however, fight savagely<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> among themselves, and
turn off from the breeding-ground all younger and weaker males.</p>

<p>A cow sea-lion is not quite half the size of an adult male;
she will measure from eight to nine feet in length osteologically,
with a weight of four or five hundred pounds; she has the same
general cast of countenance and build of the bull; but, as she
does not sustain any fasting period of over a week or ten days consecutively,
she never comes out so grossly fat as he does. With
reference to the weight of the latter, I was particularly unfortunate
in not being able to get one of those big bulls on the scales before
it had been bled, and in bleeding I know that a flood of blood
poured out which should have been recorded in the weight. Therefore
I can only estimate this aggregate avoirdupois of one of the
finest-conditioned adult male sea-lions at fourteen to fifteen hundred
pounds; an average weight, however, might safely be recorded
as touching twelve hundred pounds.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span></p>

<p>You will notice that if you disturb and drive off any portion of
the rookery, by walking up in plain sight, those nearest to you
will take to the water instantly, swim out to a distance of fifty
yards or so, leaving their pups behind, helplessly sprawled around
and about the rocks at your feet. Huddled up all together in the
surf in two or three packs or squads, the startled parents hold
their heads and necks high out of the sea, and peer keenly at you:
then, all roaring in an incessant concert, they make an orchestra
to which those deep sonorous tones of the organ in that great Mormon
tabernacle, at Salt Lake City, constitute the fittest and most
adequate resemblance.</p>

<p>You will witness an endless tide of these animals travelling to
the water, and a steady stream of their kind coming out, if you but
keep in retirement and do not disturb them. When they first issue
from the surf they are a dark chocolate brown-and-black, and
glisten; but, as their coats dry off, the color becomes an iron-gray,
passing into a bright golden rufous, which covers the entire body
alike—shades of darker brown on the pectoral patches and sterno-pectoral
region. After getting entirely dry, they seem to grow
exceedingly uneasy, and act as though oppressed by heat, until
they plunge back into the sea, never staying out, as the fur-seal
does, day after day, and week after week. The females and the
young males frolic in and out of the water, over rocks awash, incessantly,
one with another, just as puppies play upon a green sward;
and, when weary, stretch themselves out in any attitude that will
fit the character of that rock, or the lava-shingle upon which they
may happen to be resting. The movements of their supple spines,
and ball-and-socket joint attachments, permit of the most extraordinary
contortions of a trunk and limbs, all of which, no matter
how distressing to your eyes, they seem actually to relish. But
the old battle-scarred bulls of the harem stand or lie at their positions
day and night without leaving them, except to take a short
bath when the coast is clear, until the end of the season.</p>

</figure>

<p>When swimming, the sea-lion lifts its head only above the surface
long enough to take a deep breath, then drops down a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>feet below, and propels itself, for about ten or fifteen minutes, like
a cigar-steamer, at the rate of six or seven knots, if undisturbed;
but, if chased or alarmed, it seems fairly to fly under water, and
can easily maintain for a long time a speed of fourteen or fifteen
miles per hour. Like the fur-seal, its propulsion through water
is the work entirely of its powerful fore-flippers, which are simultaneously
struck out, both together, and back against the water,
feathering forward again to repeat, while the hind flippers are
simply used as a rudder oar in deflecting an ever-varying swift
and abrupt course of the animal. On land its hind flippers are
employed just as a dog uses its feet in scratching fleas—the long
peculiar toe-nails thereof seeming to reach and comb those spots
affected by vermin, which annoys it, as the fur-seal is, to a great
extent, and causes them both to enjoy a protracted scratching.</p>

<p>Again, both genera, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Callorhinus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias</i>, are happiest
when the surf is strongest and wildest. Just in proportion to the
fury of a gale, so much the greater joy and animation of these animals.
They delight in riding on the crests of each dissolving
breaker up to a moment when it fairly foams over iron-bound rocks.
At that instant they disappear like phantoms beneath the creamy
surge, to reappear on the crown of the next mighty billow.</p>

<p>When landing, they always ride on the surf, so to speak, to an
objective point: and, it is marvellous to see with what remarkable
agility they will worm themselves up steep, rocky landings, having
an inclination greater than forty-five degrees, to flat bluff-tops
above, which have an almost perpendicular drop to water.</p>

<p>As the sea-lion is without fur, its skin has little or no commercial
value.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The hair is short, an inch to an inch and a half in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
length, being longest over the nape of the neck; straight, and
somewhat coarse, varying in color as the season comes and goes.
For instance, when the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias</i> makes its first appearance in
the spring and dries out after landing, it has then a light-brownish
rufous tint, with darker shades back and under the fore flippers
and on the abdomen. By the expiration of a month or six weeks,
about June 15th, generally, this coat will then be weathered into a
glossy rufous, or ochre yellow; this tinting remains until shed along
by the middle of August, or a little earlier. After a new coat has
fairly grown, and just before an animal leaves the island rookery
in November, it is a light sepia or Vandyke brown, with deeper
shades, almost black, upon its abdomen. The cows after shedding
never color up so darkly as the bulls; but when they come back
to the land next year they return identically the same in tinting;
so that the eye, in glancing over a sea-lion rookery during June
and July, cannot discern any dissimilarity in color, at all noteworthy,
existing between the coats of the bulls and the cows; also,
the young males and yearlings appear in that same golden-brown
and ochre, with here and there an animal which is noted as being
spotted somewhat like a leopard—a yellow rufous ground predominating,
with patches of dark-brown, blotched and mottled, irregularly
interspersed over the anterior regions down to those posterior.
I have never seen any of the old bulls or cows thus mottled,
and this is likely due to some irregularity of shedding in the
younger animals; for I have not noticed it early in the season, and
it seems to fairly fade away so as not to be discerned on the same
animal at the close of its summer solstice. Many of the old bulls
have a grizzled or “salt and pepper” look during the shedding
period, which is from August 10th up to November 10th or 20th.
The pups, when born, are a rich dark-chestnut brown. This coat
they shed in October, and take one much lighter in its stead, still
darker, however, than their parents.</p>

<p>The time of arrival at, stay on, and departure from the islands,
is about the same as that which I have recorded as characteristic of
the fur-seal; but, if a winter is an open, mild one, some of the
sea-lions will frequently be seen about the shores during the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
year; and then the natives occasionally shoot them, long after the
fur-seals have entirely disappeared. Again, it does not confine its
landing to the Pribylov Islands alone, as the fur-seal unquestionably
does, with reference to such terrestrial location in our own country.
On the contrary, it is a frequent visitor to almost all of the Aleutian
Islands: it ranges, as I have said before, over the mainland coast
of Alaska, south of Bristol Bay, and about the Siberian shores to
the westward, throughout the Kuriles and the Japanese northern
waters.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span></p>

<p>When I first returned, in 1873, from the Seal Islands, those authors,
whose conclusions were accepted prior to my studies there,
had agreed in declaring that the sea-lion, so common off the port
of San Francisco, was the same animal also common in Alaska, and
the Pribylov Islands in especial; but my drawings from life, and
studies, quickly pointed out the error, for it was seen that the creature
most familiar to the Californians was an entirely different animal
from my subject of study on the Seal Islands. In other words,
while scattered examples of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias</i> were, and are, unquestionably
about and off the harbor of San Francisco, yet nine tenths
of the sea-lions there observed were a different animal—they were
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zalophus californianus</i>. This <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zalophus</i> is not much more than
half the size of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias</i>, relatively; it has the large, round, soft
eye of the fur-seal, and the more attenuated Newfoundland-dog-like
muzzle; and it never roars, but breaks out incessantly with a <em>honk,
honk, honking</em> bark, or howl.</p>

<p>No example of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zalophus</i> has ever been observed in the waters
of Bering Sea, nor do I believe that it goes northward of Cape
Flattery, or really much above Mendocino, Cal.</p>

<p>According to the natives of St. George, some sixty or seventy
years ago the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias</i> held almost exclusive possession of that
island being there in great numbers, some two or three hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
thousand strong; and they aver, also, that the fur-seals then were
barely permitted to land by these animals, and in no great number;
therefore, they assert they were directed by the Russians (<em>i.e.</em>, their
own ancestry) to hunt and worry the sea-lions off from the island:
the result was that, as the sea-lions left, the fur-seals came, so
to-day <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Callorhinus</i> occupies nearly the same ground which <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias</i>
alone covered sixty years ago. I call attention to this statement
of the people because it is, or seems to be, corroborated in the
notes of a French naturalist and traveller, who, in his description of
the Island of St. George, which he visited sixty years ago, makes
substantially the same representation.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>That great intrinsic value to the domestic service of the Aleutes
rendered by the flesh, fat, and sinews of this animal, together with
its skin, arouses the natives of St. Paul and St. George, who annually
make drives of “seevitchie,” by which they capture two or
three hundred, as the case may be. On St. George driving is
positively difficult, owing to the character of the land itself: hence,
a few only are secured there; but at St Paul unexceptional advantages
are found on Northeast Point for the capture of these shy and
timid brutes. The natives of St. Paul, therefore, are depended
upon to secure the necessary number of skins required by both
islands for their boats and other purposes. This capture of the
sea-lion is the only serious business which the people have on St.
Paul. It is a labor of great care, industry, and some physical risk
for the Aleutian hunters.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span></p>

<p>By reference to my sketch-map of Northeast Point rookery the
reader will notice a peculiar neck or boot-shaped point, which I
have designated as Sea-lion Neck. That area is a spot upon which
a large number of sea-lions are always to be found during the
season. As they are so shy and sure to take to water upon the appearance
or presence of man near by, the natives adopt this plan:
Along by the middle or end of September, as late sometimes as
November, and after the fur-seal rookeries have broken up for the
year, fifteen or twenty of the very best men in the village are selected
by one of their chiefs for a sea-lion rendezvous at Northeast
Point. They go up there with their provisions, tea, and sugar, and
blankets, and make themselves at home in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">barrabora</i> and house
which I have located on the sketch-map of Novastoshnah, prepared
to stay, if necessary, a month, or until they shall get the whole
drove together of two or three hundred sea-lions.</p>

<p>The “seevitchie,” as the natives call those animals, cannot be
approached successfully by daylight, so these hunters lie by in this
house of Webster’s until a favorable night comes along, one in
which the moon is partially obscured by drifting clouds and the
wind blows over them from the rookery where the sea-lions lie.
Such an opportunity being afforded, they step down to the beach
at low water and proceed to creep on all fours across surf-beaten
sand and boulders up between the dozing herd, and the high-water
mark where it rests. In this way a small body of natives, crawling
along in Indian file, may pass unnoticed by sea-lion sentries,
which doubtless in that uncertain light see, but confound the forms
of their human enemies with those of seals. When the creeping
Aleutes have all reached the strip of beach that is left bare by ebb-tide,
and is between the surf and those unsuspecting animals, at a
given signal from their crawling leader they at once leap to their
feet, shout, yell, brandishing their arms and firing off pistols, while
the astonished and terrified lions roar, and flounder in every direction.</p>

<p>If at the moment of surprise seevitchie are sleeping with their
heads pointed toward the water, as they rise up in fright they
charge straight on in that direction, right over the men themselves;
but those which have been resting at this instant, when startled,
pointed landward, up they rise and follow that course just as
desperately, and nothing will turn them either one way or the
other. These sea-lions which charged for the water are lost, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>course;<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> but the natives promptly follow up the land-turned animal
with a rare combination of horrible noises and demoniacal gesticulations
until the first frenzied spurt and exertions of the terrified
creatures so completely exhaust them that they fall panting, gasping,
prone upon the earth, extended in spite of their bulk and powerful
muscles, helpless, and at the mercy of their cunning captors, who,
however, instead of slaying them as they lie, rudely rouse them up
again and urge the herd along to the house in which they have been
keeping watch during the several days past.</p>

<p>Here at this point is a curious stage in such proceeding. The natives
drive up to that “Webster’s” house those twenty-five or thirty
or forty sea-lions, as the case may be, which they have just captured—they
seldom get more at any one time—and keep them in a corral
or pen close by the barrabora, on the flattened surface of a sand-ridge,
in the following comical manner: When they have huddled up
the “pod,” they thrust stakes down around it at intervals of ten to
twenty feet, to which strips of cotton cloth are fluttering as flags,
and a line or two of sinew-rope or thong of hide is strung from
pole to pole around the group, making a circular cage, as it were.
Within this flimsy circuit the stupid sea-lions are securely imprisoned,
and, though they are incessantly watched by two or three
men, the whole period of caging and penning which I observed,
extending over nine or ten days and nights, passed without a single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
effort being made by the “seevitchie” to break out of their flimsy
bonds, and it was passed by these animals, not in stupid quiescence,
but in alert watchfulness, roaring, writhing, twisting, turning one
upon and over the other.</p>

<p>By this method of procedure, after the lapse usually of two or
three weeks, a succession of favorable nights will have occurred:
then the natives secure their full quota, which, as I have said before,
is expressed by a herd of two or three hundred of these animals.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">[<em>Natives driving a drove over the plain of Polavina, en
route from Northeast Point to St. Paul.</em>]</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When that complement
is filled, the natives
prepare to drive their
herd back to the village
over the grassy and mossy
uplands and intervening
stretches of sand-dune
tracts, fully eleven
miles: preferring thus to
take the trouble of prodding
such clumsy brutes,
wayward and obstinate as
they are, rather than to
pack their heavy hides in and out of boats, making in this way each
sea-lion carry its own skin and blubber down to the doors of their
houses in the village. If the weather is normally wet and cold, this
drive or caravan of sea-lions can be driven to its point of destination
in five or six days; but should it be dry and warmer than usual,
three weeks, and even longer, will elapse before the circuit is traversed.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Natives surprising a Herd of Sea-lions at Tolstoi, St. George’s Island. August 3, 1673</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When the drive is started, the natives gather around the herd
on all sides, save an opening which they leave pointing to that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>direction they desire the animals to travel; in this manner they
escort and urge the “seevitchie” along to their final resting and
slaughter near the village. The young lions and the females,
being much lighter than old males, less laden with fat or blubber,
take the lead, for they travel twice and thrice as easy and as fast
as the latter; these, by reason of their immense avoirdupois, are
incapable of moving ahead more than a few rods at a time, then
they are completely checked by sheer loss of breath, though the
vanguard of the females allures them on; but when an old sea-lion
feels his wind coming short, he is sure to stop, sullenly and surlily
turning upon the drivers, not to move again until his lungs are clear.</p>

<p>In this method and manner of direction the natives stretch
a herd out in extended file, or as a caravan, over the line of march,
and as the old bulls pause to savagely survey the field and catch
their breath, showing their wicked teeth, the drivers have to exercise
every art and all their ingenuity in arousing them to fresh
efforts. This they do by clapping boards and bones together, firing
fusees, and waving flags; and of late, and best of all, the blue gingham
umbrella repeatedly opened and closed in the face of an old
bull has been a more effective starter than all the other known artifices
or savage expedients of the natives.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span></p>

<p>The procession of sea-lions, managed in this strange manner day
and night—for the natives never let up—is finally brought to rest
within a stone’s throw of the village, which has pleasurably anticipated
for days and for weeks its arrival, and rejoices in its appearance.
The men get out their old rifles and large sea-lion lances,
and sharpen their knives, while the women look well to their oil-pouches,
and repair to the field of slaughter with meat-baskets on
their heads.</p>

<p>No attempt is made, even by the boldest Aleut, to destroy an
adult bull sea-lion by spearing the enraged, powerful beast, which,
now familiar with man and conscious, as it were, of his puny
strength, would seize the lance between its jaws and shake it from
the hands of the stoutest one in a moment. Recourse is had to
a rifle. The herd is started up those sloping flanks of the Black
Bluff hillside; the females speedily take the front, while the old
males hang behind. Then the marksmen, walking up to within a
few paces of each animal, deliberately draw gun-sight upon their
heads and shoot them just between the eye and the ear. The old
males thus destroyed, the cows and females are in turn surrounded
by the natives, who, dropping their rifles, thrust big heavy iron
lances into their trembling bodies at a point behind the fore flippers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
touching the heart with a single lunge. It is an unparalleled
spectacle, dreadfully cruel and bloody.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>This surrounding of the cows is, perhaps, the strangest procedure
on the islands. To fully appreciate this subject the reader must
first call to his mind’s eye the fact that these female sea-lions,
though small beside the males, are yet large animals; seven and
eight feet long and weighing each as much as any four or five
average men. But, in spite of their strength and agility, fifteen or
twenty Aleutes, with rough, iron-tipped lances in their hands, will
surround a drove of fifty or one hundred and fifty of them by forming
a noisy, gesticulating circle, gradually closing up, man to man,
until the sea-lions are literally piled in a writhing, squirming,
struggling mass, one above the other, three or four deep, heads,
flippers, bellies, backs, all so woven and interwoven in this panic-stricken
heap of terrified creatures that it defies adequate description.
The natives spear those cows on top, which, as they sink in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
death, are mounted in turn by the live animals underneath; these
meet the deadly lance, in order, and so on until the whole herd is
quiet and stilled in the fatal ebbing of their hearts’ blood.</p>

<p>Although the sea-lion has little or no commercial value for us,
yet to the service of the natives themselves, who live all along the
Bering Sea coast of Alaska, Kamchatka, and the Kuriles, it is invaluable;
they set great store by it. It supplies them with its hide,
mustaches, flesh, fat, sinews, and intestines, which they make up into
as many necessary garments, food-dishes, etc. They have abundant
reason to treasure its skin highly, since it is the covering to
their neat <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bidarkas</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bidarrahs</i>, the former being the small <em>kayak</em>
of Bering Sea, while the latter is a boat of all work, exploration
and transportation. These skins are unhaired by sweating in a pile,
then they are deftly sewed and carefully stretched over a light keel
and frame of wood, making a perfectly water-tight boat that will
stand, uninjured, the softening influence of water for a day or two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
at a time, if properly air-dried and oiled. After being used during
the day these skin boats are always drawn out on the beach, turned
bottom-side up and air-dried during the night—in this way made
ready for employment again on the morrow.</p>

<p>A peculiar value is attached to the intestines of the sea-lion,
which, after skinning, are distended with air and allowed to dry
in that shape; then they are cut into ribbons and sewed strongly
together into that most characteristic rain-proof garment of the
world, known as the “kamlayka,” which, while being fully as
water-repellant as india-rubber, has far greater strength, and is
never affected by grease and oil. It is also transparent in its fitting
over dark clothes. The sea-lions’ throats are treated in a
similar manner, and when cured, are made into boot tops, which
are in turn soled by very tough skin that composes the palms of
this animal’s fore flippers.</p>

<p>The Aleutian name for this garment is unpronounceable in our
language, and equally so in the more flexible Russian; hence the
Alaskan “kamlayka,” derived from the Siberian “kamläia.” That
is made of tanned reindeer skin, unhaired, and smoked by larch
bark until it is colored a saffron yellow; and is worn over a reindeer-skin
undershirt, which has the hair next to its owner’s skin,
and the obverse side stained red by a decoction of alder-bark. The
kamläia is closed behind and before, and a hood, fastened to the
back of the neck, is drawn over the head, when leaving shelter; so
is the Aleutian kamlayka; only the one of Kolyma is used to keep
out piercing dry cold, while the garment of the Bering Sea is a perfect
water-tight affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span></p>

<p>Around the natives’ houses, on St. Paul and St. George, constantly
appear curious objects which, to an unaccustomed eye, resemble
overgrown gourds or enormous calabashes with attenuated
necks; examination proves them to be the dried, distended stomach-walls
of a sea-lion, filled with its oil—which (unlike the offensive
blubber of the fur-seal) boils out clear and inodorous from its
fat. The flesh of an old sea-lion, while not very palatable, is tasteless
and dry; but the meat of a yearling is very much like veal, and
when properly cooked I think it is just as good; but the superiority
of sea-lion meat over that of the fur-seal is decidedly marked.
It requires some skill in the <em>cuisine</em> ere sausage and steaks of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Callorhinus</i> are accepted on the table; while it does not, however,
require much art, experience, or patience for good cooks to serve
up the juicy ribs of a young sea-lion so that the most fastidious
palate will not fail to relish it.</p>

<p>The carcass of a sea-lion, after it is stripped of its hide, and
disembowelled, is hung up in cool weather by its hind flippers, over
a rude wooden frame or “laabaas,” as the natives call such a structure,
where, together with many more bodies of fur-seals treated in
the same manner, it serves from November until the following season
of May, as the meat-house for an Aleut on St. Paul and St.
George. Exposed in this manner to open weather, the natives keep
their seal-meat almost any length of time, in winter, for use; and,
like our old duck and bird-hunters, they say they prefer to have
this flesh tainted rather than fresh, declaring that it is most tender
and toothsome when decidedly “loud.”</p>

<p>The tough, elastic mustache-bristles of a sea-lion are objects of
great commercial activity by the Chinese, who prize them highly as
pickers for their opium pipes, and several ceremonies peculiar to
their joss-houses. Such lip-bristles of the fur-seal are usually too
small and too elastic for this service. The natives, however, always
carefully pluck them out of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias</i>, and get their full value
in exchange.</p>

<p>The sea-lion also, as in the case of the fur-seal, is a fish-eater,
pure and simple, though he, like the latter, occasionally varies his
diet by consuming a limited amount of juicy sea-weed fronds, and
tender marine crustaceans; but he hunts no animal whatever for
food, nor does he ever molest, up here, the sea-fowl that incessantly
hover over his head, or sit in flocks without any fear on the surface
of the waters around him. He, like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Callorhinus</i>, is, without question,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
a mighty fisherman, familiar with every submarine haunt of
his piscatorial prey; and, like his cousin, rejects the heads of all
those fish which have hard horny mouths or are filled with teeth
or bony plates.</p>

<p>Many authorities who are quoted in regard to the habits of
hair-seals and southern sea-lions speak with much fine detail of having
witnessed the capture of water-birds by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phocidæ</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Otariidæ</i>.
To this point of inquiry on the Pribylov Islands I gave continued
close attention; because, off and around all of the rookeries, large
flocks of auks, arries, gulls, shags, and choochkies were swimming
upon the water, and shifting thereupon incessantly, day and night,
throughout the late spring, summer, and early fall. During the
four seasons of my observation I never saw the slightest motion
made by a fur-seal or sea-lion, a hair-seal or a walrus, toward intentionally
disturbing a single bird, much less of capturing and eating
it. Had these seals any appetite for sea-fowl, this craving could
have been abundantly satisfied at the expense of absolutely no effort
on their part. That none of these animals have any taste for water-birds
I am thoroughly assured.</p>

<p>In concluding this recitation of that wonderful seal life belonging
to those islets of Pribylov, it is well to emphasize the fact
that, with an exception of the Russian and American seal islands of
Bering Sea, there are none elsewhere in the world of the slightest
importance to-day; the vast breeding-grounds of fur-seals bordering
on the Antarctic have been, by the united efforts of all nationalities—misguided,
short-sighted, and greedy of gain—entirely depopulated;
only a few thousand unhappy stragglers are now to be
seen throughout all that southern area, where millions once were
found, and a small rookery, protected and fostered by the government
of a South American State, north and south of the mouth of
the Rio de la Plata. When, therefore, we note the eagerness with
which our civilization calls for seal-skin fur, the fact that in spite
of fashion and its caprices this fur is and always will be an article
of intrinsic value and in demand, the thought at once occurs that
the Government is exceedingly fortunate in having this great amphibious
stock-yard, far up and away in the quiet seclusion of Bering
Sea, from which it shall draw an everlasting revenue, and on
which its wise regulation and its firm hand can continue the seals
forever.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_137" href="#FNanchor_137" class="label">[137]</a> That the sea-lion bull should be so cowardly in the presence of man,
yet so ferocious and brave toward one another and other amphibious animals,
struck me as a line of singular contrast with the undaunted bearing of a fur-seal
“seecatch,” which, though being not half the size or possessing muscular
power to anything like its development in the “seevitchie,” nevertheless
will unflinchingly face on its station at the rookery any man to the death. The
sea-lion bulls certainly fight as savagely and as desperately one with another,
as the fur-seal males do. There is no question about that, and their superior
strength and size only makes the result more effective in the exhibition of
gaping wounds and attendant bloodshed. I have repeatedly seen examples of
these old warriors of the sea which were literally scarred from their muzzles
to their posteriors so badly and so uniformly as to have fairly lost all the color
or general appearance even of hair anywhere on their bodies.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_138" href="#FNanchor_138" class="label">[138]</a> I recall in this connection the sight of an aged male sea-lion which had
been defeated by a younger and more lusty rival, perhaps. It was hauled
upon a lava shelf at Southwest Point, solitary and alone; the rock around it
being literally covered with pools of pus, that was oozing out and trickling
down from a score of festering wounds; the victim stood planted squarely on
its torn fore flippers, with head erect and thrown back upon its shoulders; its
eyes were closed, and it gently swayed its sore neck and shoulders in a sort of
troubled, painful day-dreaming or dozing. Like the fur-seal, the sea-lion
never notices its wounds to nurse and lick them, as dogs do, or other carnivora;
it never pays the slightest attention to them, no matter how grievously
it may be injured.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_139" href="#FNanchor_139" class="label">[139]</a> Often when the fur-seal and sea-lion bulls haul up in the beginning of
the season examples among them which are inordinately fat will be seen;
their extra avoirdupois renders them very conspicuous, even among large
gatherings of their kind; they seem to exhibit a sense of self-oppression then,
quite as marked as is that subsequent air of depression worn when, later, they
have starved out this load of surplus blubber, and are shambling back to the
sea, for recuperation and rest.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_140" href="#FNanchor_140" class="label">[140]</a> The sea-lion and hair-seals of Bering Sea, having no commercial value in
the eyes of civilized men, have not been subjects of interest enough to the
pioneers of those waters for mention in particular; such record, for instance, as
that given of the walrus, the sea-otter, and the fur-seal. Steller was the first to
draw the line clearly between them and seals in general, especially defining
their separation from the fur-seal; still his description is far from being definite
or satisfactory in the light of our present knowledge of the animal.</p>

<p>In the South Pacific and Atlantic the sea-lion has been curiously confounded
by many of our earliest writers with the sea-elephant, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Macrorhinus
leoninus</i>, and its reference is inextricably entangled with the fur-seal at the
Falklands, Kerguelen’s Land, and the Crozettes. The proboscidean seal, however,
seems to be the only pinniped which visits the Antarctic continent; but
that is a mere inference of mine, because so little is known of those ice-bound
coasts, and Wilkes, who gives the only record made of the subject, saw no
other animal there save that one.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_141" href="#FNanchor_141" class="label">[141]</a> The winter of 1872-73, which I passed on the Pribylov Islands, was so rigorous
that those shores were ice-bound, and the sea covered with floes from January
until May 28th; hence I did not have an opportunity of seeing, for
myself, whether the sea-lion remains about its breeding-grounds there throughout
that period. The natives say that a few of them, when the sea is open, are
always to be found, at any day during the winter and early spring, hauled out
at Northeast Point, on Otter Island, and around St. George. They are, in my
opinion, correct; and, being in such small numbers, the “seevitchie” undoubtedly
find enough subsistence in local crustacea, pisces, and other food.
The natives, also, further stated that none of the sea-lions which we observe
on the islands during the breeding-season leave the waters of Bering Sea from
the date of their birth to the time of their death. I am also inclined to agree
with this proposition, as a general rule, though it would be strange if Pribylov
sea-lions did not occasionally slip into the North Pacific, through and below
the Aleutian chain, a short distance, even to travelling as far to the eastward
as Cook’s Inlet. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias stelleri</i> is well known to breed at many places between
Attoo and Kadiak Islands. I did not see it at St. Matthew, however,
and I do not think it has ever bred there, although this island is only two hundred
miles away to the northward of the Seal Islands—too many polar bears.
Whalers speak of having shot it in the ice-packs in a much higher latitude,
nevertheless, than that of St. Matthew. I can find no record of its breeding
anywhere on the islands or mainland coast of Alaska north of the fifty-seventh
parallel or south of the fifty-third parallel of north latitude. It is common on
the coast of Kamchatka, the Kurile Islands, and the Commander group, in
Russian waters.</p>

<p>There are vague and ill-digested rumors of finding <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias</i> on the shores
of Prince of Wales and Queen Charlotte Islands in breeding rookeries; I doubt
it. If it were so, it would be authoritatively known by this time. We do find
it in small numbers on the Farallones Rocks, off the entrance to the harbor of
San Francisco, where it breeds in company with, though sexually apart from,
an overwhelming majority of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zalophus</i>; and it is credibly reported as breeding
again to the southward, on the Santa Barbara, Guadaloupe, and other
islands of Southern and Lower California, consorting there, as on the Farallones,
with an infinitely larger number of the lesser-bodied <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zalophus</i>.</p>

<p>There is no record made which shows that the fur-seals, even, have any
regular or direct course of travel up or down the northwest coast. They are
principally seen in the open sea, eight or ten miles from land, outside the
heads of the Straits of Fuca, and from there as far north as Dixon Sound.
During May and June they are aggregated in greatest numbers here, though
examples are reported the whole year around. The only fur-seal which I saw,
or was noted by the crew of the <em>Reliance</em>, in her cruise, June 1st to 9th, from
Port Townsend to Sitka, was a solitary “holluschak” that we disturbed at sea
well out from the lower end of Queen Charlotte’s Islands; then, from Sitka
to Kadiak, we saw nothing of the fur-seal until we hauled off from Point Greville,
and coming down to Ookamok Islet, a squad of agile “holluschickie”
suddenly appeared among a school of humpback whales, sporting in the most
extravagant manner around, under, and even leaping over the wholly indifferent
cetacea. From this eastern extremity of Kadiak Island clear up to the
Pribylov group we daily saw them here and there in small bands, or also as
lonely voyageurs, all headed for one goal. We were badly outsailed by
them; indeed, the chorus of a favorite “South Sea pirate’s” song, as incessantly
sung on the cutter’s “‘tween decks,” seemed to have special adaptation
to them:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_143" href="#FNanchor_143" class="label">[143]</a> A curious, though doubtless authentic, story was told me in this connection
illustrative of the strength and energy of the sea-lion bull when at
bay. Many years ago (1847), on St. Paul Island, a drive of September sea-lions
was brought down to the village in the usual style; but when the natives
assembled to kill them, on account of a great scarcity at that time of
powder on the island, it was voted best to lance the old males also, as well as
the females, rather than shoot them in the customary style. The people had
hardly set to work at the task when one of their number, a small, elderly,
though tough, able-bodied Aleut, while thrusting his lance into the “life” of a
large bull, was suddenly seen to fall on his back directly under that huge brute’s
head. Instantly the powerful jaws of the “seevitchie” closed upon the waistband,
apparently, of the native, and, lifting the yelling man aloft as a cat
would a kitten, the sea-lion shook and threw him high into the air, away over
the heads of his associates, who rushed up to the rescue and quickly destroyed
the animal by a dozen furious spear-thrusts; yet death did not loosen its
clinched jaws, in which were the tattered fragments of Ivan’s clothing.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_144" href="#FNanchor_144" class="label">[144]</a> The natives appreciate this peculiarity of the sea-lion very keenly, for
good and sufficient cause, though none of them have ever been badly injured
in driving or “springing the alarm.” I camped with them for six successive
nights of September, 1872, in order to witness the whole procedure. During
the several drives made while I was with them I saw but one exciting incident.
Everything went off in an orthodox manner, as described in the text
above. The exceptional incident occurred during the first drive of the first
night and rendered those natives so cautious that it was not repeated. When
the alarm was sprung, old Luka Mandrigan was leading the van, and at that
moment down upon him, despite his wildly gesticulating arms and vociferous
yelling, came a squad of bull “seevitchie.” The native saw instantly that
they were pointed for the water, and, in his sound sense, turned to run from
under. His tarbosars slipped upon a slimy rock awash; he fell flat as a flounder
just as a dozen or more big sea-lions plunged over and on to his prostrate form
in the shallow water. In less time than this can be written the heavy pinnipeds
had disappeared, while the bullet-like head of old Luka was quickly
raised, and he trotted back to us with an alternation of mirth and chagrin in
his voice. He was not hurt in the least.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_145" href="#FNanchor_145" class="label">[145]</a> The curious behavior of sea-lions in the Big Lake when they are <em>en
route</em> and driven from Novastoshnah to the village deserves mention. After
the drove gets over the sand-dunes and beach between Webster’s house and
the extreme northeastern head of the lake, a halt is called and the drove
“penned” on the bank there. Then, when the sea-lions are well rested, they
are started up and pell-mell into the water. Two natives in a bidarka keep
them from turning out from shore into the broad bosom of Meesulkmahnee,
while another bidarka paddles in their rear and follows their swift passage
right down the eastern shore. In this method of procedure the drive carries
itself nearly two miles by water in less than twenty minutes from the time the
sea-lions are first turned in at the north end to that moment when they are
driven out at the southeastern elbow of the Big Pond. The shallowness of
the water here accounts probably for the strange failure of these sea-lions to
regain their liberty, and it so retards their swimming as to enable the bidarka,
with two men, to keep abreast of their leaders easily, as they plunge ahead;
and, “as one goes, so all go sheep,” it is not necessary to pay attention to
those which straggle behind in the wake. They are stirred up by a second
bidarka, and none make the least attempt to diverge from that track which
the swifter mark out in advance. If they did, they could escape “scot-free”
in any one of the twenty minutes of this aquatic passage.</p>

<p>By consulting the map of St. Paul it will be observed that in a direct line
between the village and Northeast Point there are quite a number of small
lakes, including this large one of Meesulkmahnee. Into all of these ponds
the sea-lion drove is successively driven. This interposition of fresh water at
such frequent intervals serves to shorten the time of that journey fully ten
days in warmish weather, and at least four or five under the best of climatic
conditions.</p>

<p>This track between Webster’s house and the village killing-grounds is
strewn with the bones of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumetopias</i>. They will drop in their tracks now and
then, even when carefully driven, from cerebral or spinal congestion principally,
and when they are hurried the mortality <em>en route</em> is very great. The
natives when driving them keep them going day and night alike, but give
them frequent resting-spells after every spurt ahead. The old bulls flounder
along for a hundred yards or so, then sullenly halt to regain breath, five or
ten minutes being allowed them; then they are stirred up again, and so on,
hour after hour, until the tedious transit is completed.</p>

<p>The younger sea-lions and the cows which are in the drove carry themselves
easily far ahead of the bulls, and, being thus always in the van, serve
unconsciously to stimulate and coax the heavy males to travel. Otherwise I
do not believe that a band of old bulls exclusively could be driven down over
this long road successfully.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_146" href="#FNanchor_146" class="label">[146]</a> When slowly sketching, by measurements, the outlines of a fine adult
bull sea-lion which the ball from Booterin’s rifle had just destroyed, an old
“starooka” came up abruptly; not seeming to see me, she deliberately threw
down a large, greasy, skin meat-bag, and whipping out a knife, went to work
on my specimen. Curiosity prompted me to keep still, in spite of the first
sensations of annoyance, so that I might watch her choice and use of the animal’s
carcass. She first removed the skin, being actively aided in this operation
by an uncouth boy; she then cut off the palms to both fore flippers; the
boy at the same time pulled out its mustache-bristles; she then cut out its
gullet, from the glottis to its junction with the stomach, carefully divested it
of all fleshy attachments and fat; she then cut out the stomach itself, and
turned it inside out, carelessly scraping its gastric walls free of copious biliary
secretions, the inevitable bunch of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ascaris</i>; she then told the boy to take hold
of the duodenum end of the small intestine, and, as he walked away with it,
she rapidly cleared it of its attachments, so that it was thus uncoiled to its
full length of at least sixty feet; then she severed it and then it was recoiled
by the “melchiska,” and laid up with the other members just removed, except
the skin, which she had nothing more to do with. She then cut out the
liver and ate several large pieces of that workhouse of the blood before dropping
it into her meat-pouch. She then raked up several handfuls of the
“leaf-lard,” or hard, white fat that is found in moderate quantity around the
viscera of all these pinnipeds, which she also dumped into the flesh-bag; she
then drew her knife through the large heart, but did not touch it otherwise,
looking at it intently, however, as it still quivered in unison with the warm
flesh of the whole carcass. She and the boy then poked their fingers into the
tumid lobes of the immense lungs, cutting out portions of them only, which
were also put into the grimy pouch aforesaid; then she secured the gall-bladder
and slipped it into a small yeast-powder tin, which was produced by the
urchin; then she finished her economical dissection by cutting the sinews out
of its back in unbroken bulk from the cervical vertebra to the sacrum; all
these were stuffed into that skin bag, which she threw on her back and supported
it by a band over her head; she then trudged back to the barrabkie
from whence she sallied a short hour ago, like an old vulture to the slaughter.
She made the following disposition of its contents: The palms were used to
sole a pair of tarbosars, or native boots, of which the uppers and knee-tops
were made of the gullets—one sea-lion gullet to each boot-top; the stomach
was carefully blown up and left to dry on the barrabkie roof, eventually to be
filled with oil rendered from sea-lion or fur-seal blubber. The small intestine
was carefully injected with water and cleansed, then distended with air, and
pegged out between two stakes, sixty feet apart, with little cross-slats here and
there between to keep it clear of the ground. When it is thoroughly dry it
is ripped up in a straight line with its length and pressed out into a broad
band of parchment gut, which she cuts up and uses in making a water-proof
“kamlayka,” sewing it with those sinews taken from the back. The liver,
leaf-lard, and lobes of the lungs were eaten without further cooking, and the
little gall-bag was for some use in poulticing a scrofulous sore. The mustache-bristles
were a venture of the boy, who gathers all that he can, then sends
them to San Francisco, where they find a ready sale to the Chinese, who pay
about one cent apiece for them. When the natives cut up a sea-lion carcass
or one of a fur-seal, on the killing-grounds for meat, they take only the hams
and the loins. Later in the season they eat the entire carcass, which they hang
up by its hind flippers on a “laabas” by their houses.</p>

</figure>

<p class="no-indent">“Nooshagak” is not a very euphonious name, yet it is employed in
Alaska to express the whole of an immense area that backs the
borders of Bristol Bay; but, when strictly applied, it is the designation
of a small trading-post at the head of a large, brackish estuary
of the sea, into which the Nooshagak River pours its heavy
flood. A cruise of three hundred and eighty miles to the northeast
from Oonalashka in a trim little trading-schooner, which alone can
make the landing, takes you to this old and well-known Russian
outpost; but the mariner who pilots that vessel must be well acquainted
with those perilous shoals and tide-rips of Bristol Bay, or
you will never disembark at the foot of that staircase which leads
up to the doors of Alexandrovsk. The river here is a broad arm of
the sea, full of shifting sand-bars and mud-flats which try the temper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>of the most patient and skilful navigator. It runs over these
shallows at certain turns of the tide, like the ebb and flow in the
Bay of Fundy, with a big, booming tidal wave, or “bore.” The current
of this river may be discerned for a long distance out into Bristol
Bay, easily traced at the season of high water by its turbidity.</p>

<p>Above the settlement of Nooshagak that river rapidly narrows
into a width of half a mile between banks for a long distance up its
winding course. It is very deep, with a succession of ripples, or
bars, that prevent navigation. When the northern bend is reached,
then it changes to a brawling, swift, and shoal current, with higher
rocky banks up to its source in the big lake which bears its guttural
name. It is clear and pure here, and is not muddy until it
reaches the shelving, alluvial banks of its lower course, which precipitate,
by their caving and washing out, large quantities of soil
and timber into the stream. Its shores are, and all the country back
is, thickly wooded by spruce forests, and parked with grassy slopes
which reach out here and there, planted sparsely with thickets and
clumps of graceful birch- and poplar-trees. These nod and wave
their tremulous foliage as the summer gusts sweep now and then
over them. Countless pools, ponds, and lakes nestle in the moors
and in the forest hollows, upon which flocks of geese, ducks, and
all other kinds of hardy water-fowl breed and moult their plumage
during the short, hot summer. The traders say that this river is
the only one in Alaska, of the least magnitude, which has banks on
both sides of firm soil throughout its entire course.</p>

<p>This site of Nooshagak village was an initial point of Russian
influence and trade among the great Innuit people of Alaska, who
live extended in their numerous settlements from the head of Bristol
Bay clear to the Arctic Ocean. Kolmakov established the post
in 1834, and named it Alexandrovsk. A simple cylindrical wooden
shaft, twenty feet high, surmounted with a globe, stands erected to
his memory on a small hillock overlooking the post below. The
village itself is located on the abrupt slopes of a steep, grassy hillside
which rises from the river’s edge. The trading-stores and the
residence of the priest, the church, log-huts of the natives and their
barraboras are planted on a succession of three earthen terraces,
one rising immediately behind the other. All communication from
flat to flat is by slippery staircases, which are fraught with great
danger to a thoughtless pedestrian, especially when fogs moisten
the steps and darkness obscures his vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span></p>

<p>The red-roofed, yellow-painted walls of the old Russian buildings,
the smarter, sprucer dwellings of our traders, with lazy,
curling wreaths of bluish smoke, are brought into very picturesque
relief by the verdant slopes of Nooshagak’s hillside, caught up and
reflected deeply by the swiftly flowing current of the river below.
The natives have festooned their long drying-frames with the crimson-tinted
flesh of salmon; bleached drift-logs are scattered in profusion
upon a bare sandy high-water bench that stretches like a
buff-tinted ribbon just beneath them, and above, the dark, turbid
whirl of flood and eddy so characteristic of a booming, rising river.
A gleam of light falls upon a broad expanse of the estuary beyond
that point under which the schooner lies at anchor, and brings out
the thickly wooded banks of an opposite shore, causing us to note
the fact that, for some reason or other, no timber seems ever to
have spread down so far toward the sea on this side of the stream,
or where the settlement stands, since nothing but scattered copses
of alder- and willow-bushes grow on its suburbs or anywhere else
as far as an eye can range up the valley.</p>

<p>We notice a decided difference in bearing and expression among
the natives here—nothing like what we have studied at Oonalashka,
Kadiak, or Sitka. They are Innuits, or representatives of the most
populous savage family indigenous to Alaska, and are as nomadic as
Bedouins. They are the least changed or altered by contact with
our race. They are Eskimo, strictly speaking, and the natives of
Kadiak are almost strictly related to them. In portraying the physique,
physiognomy, and disposition of these people, we find in an
average Innuit a man who stands about five feet six or seven inches
in his heelless boots; his skin is fair, slightly Mongolian in its complexion
and facial expression; a broad face, prominent cheek-bones,
a large mouth with full lips, small black eyes, but prominently
set in their sockets—not under a lowering brow, as in the case
of true Indian faces. The nose is very insignificant and much depressed,
having between the eyes scarcely any bridge at all. He
has an abundance of coarse black hair; never any of a reddish hue,
as frequently noted among the Aleutes when first discovered and
described by the Russians. Up to the age of thirty years an Innuit
usually keeps his hair cut pretty close to his scalp; some of
them shave the occiput, so that it shines like a billiard-ball. After
this period in life he lets it grow as it will, wearing it in ragged,
unkempt locks. He sometimes will sport a well-developed mustache<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
and chin-whisker, of which he is as proud as though a
Caucasian. He has shapely hands and feet; his limbs are well
made, formed, and muscled. An Innuit woman is proportionately
smaller than the man, and, when young, sometimes she is not unpleasant
to look at. The skin of her cheeks then will be faintly
suffused with blushes of natural color, her lips pouting and red,
with small, tapering hands and high-instepped feet. She rarely
pierces her lips or disfigures her nose; she lavishes upon her child
or children a wealth of affectionate attention—endows them with
all her ornaments. She allows her hair to grow to its full length,
gathers it up behind into thick braids, or else it is bound up in
ropes lashed by copper wire or sinews. She seldom tattooes her
skin in any place; a faint drawing of transverse blue lines upon the
chin and cheeks is usually made by her best friend when she is
married.</p>

<p>We are not reminded of the clothing stores of San Francisco
when we meet Innuits everywhere between Point Barrow and Nooshagak;
they are clad in the primitive garments of their remote
ancestry, as a rule—a few exceptions to this generalization being
those individuals who are living constantly about the widely scattered
trading-posts, and the chapels, or missions, located in their
territory, where they act as servants or interpreters. The conventional
coat of these people is the “parka,” made of marmot and
muskrat-skins, or of tanned reindeer-hides, with enormous winter
hoods, or collars, of dog-hair or fox-fur. This parka has sleeves,
and compasses the body of the wearer, without an opening either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
before or behind, from his neck to his feet. His head is thrust
through an aperture left for it, with a puckering string which draws
it up snugly around the neck. In winter the heavy hood-collar, or
cowl, is fitted so as to be drawn over his entire head and pulled
down to the eyes. This parka is worn with singular ease and
abandon; frequently the arms are withdrawn from the big, baggy
sleeves and stowed under the waist-slack of the garment, leaving
these empty appendages to dangle. Natives, as they sit down,
draw the parka out and over the knees, still keeping their arms underneath;
or, when on the trail, and the wet grass and bushes make
it imperative, the parka is gathered up and bound by a leather
thong-strap or girdle of sinews, so as to keep its bottom border dry
and as high as the knees of a tramping native; the baggy folds
of it then give its wearer a grotesque and clumsy figure as they
bulge out over his hips and abdomen. The most favored and valuable
parka is that one made out of alder-bark tanned reindeer-skin,
for winter use; the hair is worn inside, next to the skin. For summer
styles those fashioned out of the breasts of water-fowl, of marmot-
and mink-skins, are most common. The hood is never attached
to the parka in the warmer months of the year. It is a very capacious
pouch which, when not in service, is resting in thick folds
back of the head and upon the shoulders. It is ornamented in a
variety of ways, but usually a thick fringe of long-haired dog- or
fox-fur forms its border, and when drawn into position encircles
the wearer’s face and gives it a wild and unkempt air.</p>

<p>The only underwear which a Mahlemoöt affects is limited to
that garment which we call a shirt, made of light skins or of cheap
cotton drillings; if it is of skin, it is worn from father to son, and
becomes a real heirloom highly polished and redolent. Their trousers
are, for both sexes, a pair of thin skin or cotton drawers, puckered
at the ankles and bound about with the uppers of their
moccasons, or else enclosed by the tops to their reindeer-boots,
which are the prevalent covering for their feet. Such are the characteristics
of a costume worn by much more than half the entire
aboriginal population of Alaska; but when we come to inspect
their dwellings we find a greater variety of housing than indexed in
dressing.</p>

<p>A very great majority of the Innuits live in a house that outwardly
resembles a circular mound of earth, seven or eight feet high,
and thirty or forty feet in circumference. It is overgrown with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>rank grasses, littered with all sorts of utensils, weapons, sleds, and
other Eskimo furniture. A small spiral coil of smoke rises from a
hole in its apex, a dog or two are crouching upon it, and children
climb up and roll down its sides, scattering bones and fragments of
fish and meat as they eat in the irregular fashion of these people.
A rude pole scaffolding stands close by, upon which, high above the
reach of dogs, is a wooden cache, containing all winter stores of dried
provision, “ukali,” and the like. This hut is usually right down upon
the sea-beach, just above high tide, or high-water mark, on the river
banks, for these savages draw their sustenance largely, even wholly
in many instances, from the piscine life of those northern streams.</p>

</figure>

<p>All these tribes have summer dwellings distinct from those used
during the winter. For the winter houses a square excavation of
about ten feet or more is made, in the corners of which posts of
drift-wood or whale-ribs from eight to ten feet in height are set up;
the walls are formed by laying posts of drift-wood one above the
other against the corner-posts; outside of this another wall is built,
sometimes of stone, sometimes of logs, the intervals being filled
with earth or rubble; the whole of the structure, including the
roof, is covered with sods, leaving a small opening on top, that
can be closed by a frame over which a thin, transparent seal-skin is
tightly drawn. The entrance to one of these houses consists of a
narrow, low, underground passage from ten to twelve feet in length,
through which an entrance can only be accomplished on hands and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
knees. The interior arrangement of such a winter house is simple,
and is nearly the same with all these tribes. A piece of bear-
or reindeer-skin is hung before an inner opening of the doorway;
in the centre of the enclosure is a fireplace, which is a square excavation
directly under that smoke-hole in the roof; the floor is
rarely planked, and frequently two low platforms, about four feet in
width, extend along the sides of the house from the entrance to the
back, and covered with mats and skins which serve as beds at night.
In the larger dwellings, occupied by more than one family, the
sleeping-places of each are separated from each other by suspended
mats, or simply by a piece of wood. All the bladders containing
oil, the wooden vessels, kettles, and other domestic utensils, are
kept in the front part of the dwelling, and before each sleeping-place
there is generally a block of wood upon which is placed the
oil-lamp used for heating and cooking.</p>

<p>The only ingress or egress is afforded by a small, low, irregularly
shaped aperture (it cannot rightfully be called a door), through
which the natives stoop and enter, passing down a foot or two
through a short, depressed passage that is created by the thickness
of the walls to the hut; the floor is hard-tramped earth, and the
ground-plan of it a rude circle, or square, twelve, fifteen, or twenty
feet in diameter, as the case may be, and in which the only light of
day comes feebly in from a small smoke-opening at the apex of the
roof, the ceiling of which rises tent-like from the floor. A faint,
smouldering fire is always made directly in the centre, and the atmosphere
of the apartment is invariably thick and surcharged with
its combustion.</p>

<p>Hard and rude are the beds of the Innuit—a clumsy shelf of
poles is slightly elevated above the earth, and placed close against
the walls; upon this staging the skins of bears and reindeer, seals,
and even walrus-hides, together with mats of plaited sedge and
bark, are laid; sometimes these bedsteads are mere platforms of sod
and peat. If the hut stands in a situation where it is exposed to
the full force of boisterous storms, then the architect builds a rough
hallway of earth and sods, with a bulging expansion, whereby room
is given in which to shelter his dogs and keep many utensils and
traps under cover. He also, in warm weather, lives outside of this
winter hut, to a great degree, when at home; and, for that purpose,
he builds a summer cook-house, or kitchen, which resembles
the igloo itself, only it is not more than five or six feet square, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
no higher than a stooping posture within warrants. This is also a
great resort for his dogs, which renders the place very offensive
to us.</p>

<p>The summer houses are erected above ground, and are generally
slight pole frames, roofed with skins and open in front; fire is
rarely made in them, and therefore they have no opening in the
roof, all cooking being done in the open air during fine weather.
They seldom have flooring, but otherwise the interior arrangements
resemble those of the winter houses. The store-houses of all our
Eskimo tribes are set on posts at a height of from eight to ten
feet above the ground, to protect them from foxes, wolves, and dogs.
They have generally a small square opening in front that can be
closed with a sliding board, and which is reached by means of a
notched stick of wood. These boxes are seldom more than eight
feet square by three or four feet in height.</p>

<p>The routine of life which these natives of the Nooshagak and
Kuskokvim valleys and streams follow is one of much activity—they
are on the tramp or are paddling up and down the rivers pretty
much all of the time. A year is divided up by them about as
follows: In February they prepare to go to the mountains, and go
then most of them do, though some will be as late as April in getting
away on account of their children, or of sheer laziness. They
move with the entire family outfit, bag and baggage, dogs, sleds,
and boats. They settle down along by the small mountain streams,
trap martens, shoot deer, and dig out beaver. February and March
are the best months for marten, April and May for the beaver, bear,
and land-otter.</p>

<p>By June 10th they return to their winter villages and visit the
trading-posts. They then begin their preparations for salmon-fishing,
getting their traps into shape so as to be used effectively when
those fish begin to run. They air-dry salmon on frames, and put the
heads in holes and allow them to rot slightly before eating; also
the spawn, which, however, is preserved in oil, and used as a great
delicacy during their own festivals in the midwinter season. The
salmon-fishing is all over about July 20th. By August 10th these
nomads return to the mountains, leaving the old women and youngest
children with their mothers in charge of the caches at the villages.
This time they go for reindeer, which have just shed their
hair and are in the full beauty of new, fine, sleek coats. They
hunt these animals from that time until the middle of September,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
when the fur of the beaver is again in prime condition; then <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castor
canadensis</i> receives their undivided attention. They catch these
giant rodents in wooden “dead-falls,” and also by breaking open
the dams, which causes the water to suddenly leave the beavers fully
exposed to the spears of their savage human enemies.</p>

<p>When the first snow flies in October they rig up rude deer-skin
boats, like the “bull-boats” on the Missouri, and float all their traps
and rude equipage down the river back from whence they started.
They all return for the winter by the middle of October; then, without
going far from the vicinity of their settlements, they renew and
set up fresh dead-fall traps for marten—they never go any distance
from home for this little animal, and when ice forms on the rivers,
about the end of October or early in November, they put their white-fish
traps under it. The marten-trapping is abandoned in December,
because the intense, stormy, and cold weather then drives these
pine-weasels into winter holes, where they remain semi-dormant
until the end or middle of February. During this period of severe
wintry weather the Innuit gives himself up to unrestrained loafing
and vigorous dancing festivals, which last until the year is again
renewed by going out to the mountains in February.</p>

<p>These natives of the Nooshagak and Kuskokvim regions have a
large and varied natural food-supply. They have reindeer-meat,
the flesh of moose, of bears, and of all the smaller fur-bearing
animals found in this territory—the list is a full one, comprising
land-otters, cross, red, and black foxes, the mink, the marten, the
marmot, and the ground-squirrel, or “yeavrashka,” which last is
the most abundant. The bears are all brown in this country—no
black ones. They also secure large gray and white wolves, while
those who live right on the coast of Bering Sea get walrus, the
big “mahklok” seal, and a little harbor <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phoca</i>, or “nearhpah.”</p>

<p>They have a great abundance of water-fowl, such as geese,
ducks, and the small waders, and they occasionally kill a beluga, or
white grampus, and at still more rare intervals they find a stranded
whale, which is set upon and eaten. They save carefully all the oil
which comes from marine mammals; they treasure it up in seal-skin
bags that are placed high up above the reach of dogs and
foxes on a frame scaffold which adjoins every hut. Fish-oil is also
secured in the same manner; it answers a threefold purpose—it
serves for food, for fuel, and for light, and it is a luxurious skin
and hair dressing for them all, old and young.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span></p>

<p>Fish they capture in the greatest abundance, and the variety is
quite fair. Salmon is the staff, and is found in all of the thousand
and one lakes and sluggish or rapid streams that run from them
into the greater rivers, where a mighty rush of the same fish is annually
made up in June and July from Bering Sea. In all of the
deeper lakes, and the big rivers, a variety of large white-fish and
trout are found, especially prized and searched for by these people
in midwinter, when they are trapped there in wicker-work baskets
and pole weirs under ice.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">The Big Mahklok.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In round numbers these Eskimo, or Innuits, of Alaska, number
nearly eighteen thousand souls; they inhabit the entire coast-line
of Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean, with an exception of the Aleutian
chain and that portion of the peninsula west of Oogashik. The
numerous subdivisions of this great family are based wholly upon
dialectic differentiation, and as its elaboration would entail a dreary
and uninteresting chapter upon any reader save a studious ethnologist,
it will not be itemized here. These Eskimo are all hunters
and fishermen; those land animals to which we have made allusion
are pursued by them at the proper seasons of the year. They do
not have much, in the aggregate, of value to a trader; it is chiefly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
oil and walrus-ivory. Their proximity to a relatively warm coast
renders the furs which they get of small value comparatively, since
these pelts are paler and lighter-haired than those brought in from
the distant interior, where the winters are vastly colder and longer.
But an Innuit does not require a great deal from the trader—he is
very much more independent than is his semi-civilized Aleutian
brother; his wants are only a small supply of lead and powder, of
sugar and of tobacco, a little red cloth and a small sack of flour which
suffice for a large Innuit family during the year. The flour he makes
up into pancakes and fries them in rancid oil; but, as a rule, all cooking
is a mere boiling or stewing of fish and meat in sheet-iron or copper
kettles. In those huts where they can afford to use tea, a small
number of earthenware cups and saucers will be found carefully
treasured in a little cupboard; but they never set a table or think
of such a thing, except those highly favored individuals who live as
servants about the trading-posts and missions, where they do boil
a “samovar” (tea-urn) and spread a cloth over the top of a box or
rude table upon which to place their teacups.</p>

<p>Down here at Nooshagak these natives have earned a distinction
of being the most skilful sculptors of the whole northern range.
Their carvings in walrus-ivory are exceedingly curious, and beautifully
wrought in many examples. The patience and fidelity with
which they cut from walrus-tusks delicate patterns furnished them
by the traders are equal in many respects to that remarkable display
made in the same line by the Chinese, and so much admired.
Time to them, at Nooshagak, is never reckoned, and it does not
raise a ripple of concern in the Innuit’s mind when, as he carves
upon a tusk of white ivory, he pauses to think whether he shall be
six hours or six months engaged upon the task. Shut up as he is
from December until the end of February in his dark and smoky
hut, he welcomes the task as one which enables him to “kill time”
most agreeably, and bring in a trifle, at least, to him from the trader
in the way of credit or of direct revenue.</p>

<p>All of these people, when they go hunting, use firearms of modern
patterns and many old flint-lock muskets; for fish and bird-capture
they never waste any precious ammunition; they employ
spears and arrows of most artful construction and effective service.
But a large number of those very primitive Eskimo, the Togiaks,
just west and north of Nooshagak, use nothing at all in the chase
other than the same antique bows and spears of a remote ancestry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
The disposition of these people is one of greater <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonhomie</i> than
that evidenced by the Aleutes or the Koloshians, who are rather
taciturn. The Innuit is very independent in his bearing, without
being at all vindictive or ugly. He is light-hearted, enjoys conversation
with his fellows, tells jokes with great gusto, sings rude songs
with much animation, in excellent time but with no music, and
dances with exceeding exhilaration during the progress of those
savage festivals which he calls in to enliven a long dreary winter
solstice.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">The Kashga.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Such a man is naturally quite sociable. Hence we find in every
Innuit settlement, big or little, a town hall, or “kashga.” This is a
building put up after the pattern of all winter houses in the village,
but of very much larger dimensions; some of the more populous
hamlets boast of a kashga which will measure as much as sixty
feet square, and be from twenty to thirty feet high under its smoky
rafters. A raised platform from the earth, of rough-hewn planks,
runs all around the walls of the interior, and in the largest council-houses
a series of three tiers of such staging is observed. The fireplace
in the centre is large, often three or four feet deep and eight
feet square; on ordinary days in the spring, and during the summer
and early fall, when no fire is wanted, it is covered with planks.
An underground tunnel-entrance to the kashga is made just as it is
into some of the family huts, only here it is divided at the end; one
branch leads to a fireplace below the flooring, and the other rises
to the main apartment. The natives are obliged to crawl on all
fours when they enter that underground passage or leave the
kashga through its dark opening.</p>

<p>This is the great and sole rendezvous of the men and older boys
of most settlements. The bachelors and widowers sleep here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
prepare their simple meals; the village guest and visitors of the
male sex are all quartered here; the discussion of all the town affairs
is conducted here; the tanning of skins, the plaiting and
weaving of wicker-work fish-traps, and the manufacture of sleds
and dog-harness, spear- and arrow-heads, and carving of wood and
ivory—in fact, everything done by these people under shelter, of
that kind, is executed on the platforms of a kashga. It is the
theatre for the absurd and vigorous masked dances and mummery
of their festivals, and above all, it is the spot chosen for that vile
ammoniacal bath of the Eskimo, the most popular of all their recreations.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p3860_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">Section showing Subterranean Entrance and Interior of a Kashga.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The daily routine of living as practised by an Innuit family is
exceedingly simple. The head of the household usually sleeps over
night in the kashga, as do all of his peers. His wife in the early
morning rolls out of her rude deer-skins, retucks her parka about
her hips, and starts up the smouldering fire which she banked with
ashes before going to sleep. A little meat or fish is soon half-boiled,
and a small kantag of oil is decanted, a handful of dried
berries thrown into it, and perhaps she has a modicum of rotten
fish-roe to add. This she takes out to her husband in the kashga,
rousing him, if he is not awake, with a gentle but firm admonition.
A large bowl of fresh water is also brought by her, and then everything
is before the husband for his breakfast. She returns to her
hut after he has finished, and feeds her children and herself. If
she or her husband has a male visitor, he is served in the same way.
When the evening meal is ready, sometimes the men go home and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
dine with their families; but the women and children invariably
eat at home, and when they wait upon the males in the town hall
they always turn their backs to them while the men are dining, it
being considered a gross breach of good manners for a woman to
look at a man when he is eating.</p>

<p>After breakfast the male Innuits start out, if the weather permits,
to hunt or fish, as the case may be. If a driving storm prevents
them, then indoor work is resumed or recourse to sleep again
assumed. At some time in the afternoon the fire is usually drawn
from the hot stoves on the hearth, the water and a kantag of chamber-lye
poured over them, which, arising in dense clouds of vapor,
gives notice (by its presence and its horrible ammoniacal odor) to
the delighted inmates that the bath is on. The kashga is heated
to suffocation, it is full of smoke, and the outside men run in from
their huts, with wisps of dry grass for towels, and bunches of alder-twigs
to flog their naked bodies. They throw off their garments;
they shout and dance and whip themselves into profuse perspiration
as they caper in the hot vapor. More of their disgusting substitute
for soap is rubbed on, and produces a lather which they
rinse off with cold water; and, to cap the full enjoyment of this
satanic bath, these naked actors rush out and roll in a snow-bank
or plunge into the icy flood of some lake or river adjoining, as the
season warrants. This is the most enjoyable occasion of an Innuit’s
existence, so he solemnly affirms. Nothing else affords him
a tithe of the infinite pleasure which this orgie gives him. To us,
however, there is nothing so offensive about him as that stench
which such a performance arouses.</p>

<p>When a bath is over, the smoke-hole is reopened (it was closed
during the process!), and fresh air descends upon those men who
sit around upon the platforms stupefied by that smoke and weak
from their profuse perspiration. Slowly these terrible odors leave
the kashga, and only the minor ones remain, rendering it quite
habitable once more. Night comes on: the huge stone lamps are
filled with seal-oil and lighted; the men soon lop down for sleep in
their reindeer-skins or parkas, removing their trousers only, which
they roll up and use as pillows, tucking the parka snugly over and
around their bended knees, which are drawn up tightly to the abdomen.
In the morning whoever happens to awake first relights
the lamp, if any of the fluid remains over; if not, he goes to his
own cache and gets a supply. If he is a bachelor, he attends then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
to making a fresh fire in the hearth below and prepares his coarse
breakfast.</p>

<p>The women assist their husbands in harnessing and unharnessing
the dogs; they go out and gather the firewood, and employ
themselves in sewing, patching, and making thread from deer-tendons.
They plait grass mats and weave grass stockings, because
nearly all of the coast Innuits wear socks very skilfully made of
dried grass. The boys and girls scatter about the vicinity looking
after their snares and traps, or engage, in hilarious groups, playing
at ball and leap-frog games, tag, and jumping matches. They harness
up the young dogs and the pups, and sport for hours at a
time with them.</p>

<p>These people are savages, and not at all affected by the earnest
and persistent attempts of the Russian priests to Christianize them.
They are even less influenced by the teachings of missionaries than
the Siwashes of the Sitkan archipelago, and that is saying a great
deal for their hardness of heart. They are a brave race, and have
displayed the utmost physical courage in fighting their way up the
great rivers, Yukon, Kuskokvim, and Nooshagak, whereby they displaced
and destroyed the Indians who once lived there. The Koltchanes,
or Ingaleeks of the interior, who disputed that privilege
with them, bear cheerful witness to this fact. But all such strife
between the two great families is only known to us by legends
which they recite of ancient time. No trace of recent war can be
found among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span></p>

<p>They have no ear for music; they are not fond of it like the
Aleutes, yet they keep perfect time to cultivated tunes and melodies
of our own order. The song of an Innuit is essentially like
that of his Sitkan relative: it is usually a weird dirge, monotonous,
and long-drawn out, accompanied by a regular and rhythmic beating
of a rude drum, or a dry stick, or resonant bag. Some of the
native Innuit chantings, when rendered intelligible to us, have a
plaintive pathos running through them which is attractive and are
simple in composition; but such ballads are very, very rare. The
majority are tedious and boastful recitations of a singer’s achievements
on land or water when engaged in hunting or fishing. Their
mythology is the rudest and the least ornate of all savage races, unless
it be that perfect vacuum of the Australasians and Terra del
Fuegians.</p>

<p>These savages respect the dead, but they fear the sick. When
death invades an Innuit family, taking the husband, or the wife, or
a child, the survivors eat nothing, after the decease of the relative,
but sour or last year’s food, and refrain from going out or from
work of any sort for a period of twenty days. They seat themselves
in one corner of the hut, or “kahsime,” with their backs toward
the door. Every five days they wash themselves, otherwise death
would promptly come to them again. The body of the dead native
is composed in a sitting position, with its knees drawn up to the
stomach and its arms clasped around them. It is placed in one
corner, with its head against the wall. The inhabitants of that village
where the dead man has lived voluntarily bring to the hut
dresses of reindeer-skin, in one of which the corpse is shrouded.
A coffin, or box, is prepared at some selected spot outside of the
village, set up a few feet from the ground, on four stoutly driven
posts, and in it the body is deposited. Near by is planted a square
board or smoothly hewn plank, upon which rude figures are painted
of the animals that the deceased was most fond of hunting, such as
a beaver, a deer, a fish, or seal. A few of his most cherished belongings
are laid in the coffin with him, but the balance of his property
is divided among his family.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span></p>

<p>A festival in honor of the spirits of land and sea, and in memory
of deceased kinsmen, is celebrated annually in the month of October
or November. Lieutenant Zagoskin,<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> who spent five years
among these people exploring the Yukon and Kuskokvim Rivers,
has given us full details of that strange mummery and capers
which characterize Innuit festivals and dances. What he saw between
1842 and 1845, and so graphically narrated, is to be seen substantially
the same now everywhere among these people, who are
almost wholly unchanged from their primeval habits as they live
to-day.</p>

<p>Of the tribal organization of these people but little is known:
yet, there seems to be no recognized chieftainship—each isolated
settlement generally contains one man who makes himself prominent
by superintending all intercourse and traffic with visitors.
The profits accruing to him from this position give him some slight
influence among his people; but the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oomailik</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oomuialik</i> of Zagoskin),
as these middlemen or spokesmen are called, possess no authority
over the people of their village, who pay far more attention
to the advice or threats of sorcerers, shamans, or “medicine men.”
In the festivals, consisting of feasting, singing, and dancing, with
which these hyperboreans while away the long winter nights, the
shamans also play a prominent part, directing the order of the performances
and the manufacture of masks, costumes, etc., while the
oomailik or spokesman sinks back into insignificance for the time
being.</p>

<p>All these games, both private and public, take place in the
kashga. At the public performances the dancers and singers, men
and women, stand around the fire-hole; and the men, to the time
of the drum and the singing, go through various contortions of the
body, shifting from one foot to the other without moving from the
spot, the skill of the dancer being displayed only in the endurance
and flexibility of his muscles. The women, on the other hand, with
their eyes cast down, motionless, with the exception of a spasmodic
twitching of the hands, stand around in a circle, forming, we may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
say, a living frame to the animated picture within. The less motion
a dancer displays the greater his skill. There is nothing indecent
in the dances of our sea-board natives. The dancing dress of
the men consists of short tight drawers made of white reindeer-skin
and the summer boots of soft moose-hide, while the women
on those occasions only add ornaments, such as rings and bracelets
and bead-pendants, to their common dress, frequently weighting
themselves down with ten or fifteen pounds of these baubles.</p>

<p>An entertainment of the women was described by Zagoskin as
follows:</p>

<p>“We entered the kashga by the common passage and found the
guests already assembled, but of the landladies nothing was to be
seen. On three sides of the apartment stone lamps were lighted;
the fire-hole was covered with boards, one of them having a circular
opening, through which the women were to make their appearance.
Two other burning lamps were placed in front of the fire-hole.
The guests then formed a chorus and began to sing to the
sound of the drum, two men keeping them in order by beating time
with sticks adorned with wolfs’ tails and gulls’ wings. Thus a good
half-hour passed by. Of the song my interpreter told me that it
consisted of pleasantry directed against the women; that it was evident
they had nothing to give, as they had not shown themselves
for so long a time. Another song praised the housewifely accomplishments
of some woman whose appearance was impatiently expected
with a promised trencher of the mixed mess of reindeer-fat
and berries. No sooner was this song finished than that woman appeared
and was received with the greatest enthusiasm. The dish
was set before the men, and she retreated amid vociferous compliments
on her culinary skill. She was followed by another woman.
The beating of drums increased in violence and the wording
of the song was changed. Standing up in the centre of the
circle this woman began to relate, in mimicry and gesture, how she
obtained the fat, how she stored it in various receptacles, how she
cleansed and melted it, and then, placing a kantag upon her head,
she invited the spectators with gestures to approach. The song
went on, while eagerness to partake of the promised luxury lighted
up the faces of the crowd. At last the wooden spoons were distributed,
one to each man, and nothing was heard for a time but the
guzzling of the luscious fluid. Another woman advanced, followed
still by another, and luxuries of all kinds were produced in quick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
succession and as quickly despatched, while the singers pointedly
alluded to the praiseworthy Russian custom of distributing tobacco.
When the desired article had been produced, a woman then represented
with great skill all the various stages of stupefaction resulting
from smoking and snuffing. The women dressed in men’s parkas.”</p>

<p>A man’s entertainment witnessed by Zagoskin took place in
the same village. The preparatory arrangements were similar;
one of the women, a sorceress, lead the chorus. Her first song
on that occasion praised a propensity of the Russian for making
presents of tobacco, rings, and other trifles to women, who, in
their turn, were always ready to oblige them. This, however, was
only introductory, the real entertainment beginning with a chorus
of men concealed in the fire-hole. The gist of their chant was
that trapping, hunting, and trade were bad, that nothing could be
made, and that they could only sing and dance to please their wives.
To this the women answered that they had long been aware of the
laziness of their husbands, who could do nothing but bathe and
smoke, and that they did not expect to see any food produced, such
as the women had placed before them, consequently it would be
better to go to bed at once. The men answered that they would
go and hunt for something, and shortly one of them appeared
through the opening. This mimic, who was attired in female apparel,
with bead-pendants in his nose, deep fringes of wolverine
tails, bracelets, and rings, imitated in a most admirable and humorous
manner the motions and gestures of the women in presenting
their luxuries, and then gave imitations of the various female pursuits
and labor, the guests chuckling with satisfaction. Suddenly
the parka was thrown off, and the man began to represent how he
hunted the mahklok, seated in his kayak, which performance ended
with the production of a whole boiled mahklok, of which Zagoskin
received the throat as his portion. Others represented a reindeer-hunt,
the spearing of birds, the rendering of beluga-blubber, the
preparation of seal-intestines for water-proof garments, the splitting
of deer-tendons into thread, and so forth. One young orphan who,
possessing nothing wherewith to treat the guests, brought on a
kantag filled with water, which was drunk by the women amid
much merriment. It sometimes happens on these occasions that
lovers of fun sprinkle the women with oil, or with that fluid which
they use in place of soap, squirted from small bladders concealed
about their persons; and such jokes are never resented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span></p>

<p>Another festival, in honor of the spirits of the sea (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ugiak</i>), is
celebrated by the coast tribes during a whole month. The preparations
for this gathering begin early in the autumn. Every
hunter preserves during an entire year the bladders from all such
animals as he kills with arrows; the mothers also save with the
greatest care the bladders of all rats, mice, ground-squirrels, or
other small animals killed by their children. At the beginning of
December all these bladders are inflated, painted in various colors,
and suspended in the kashga; and among them the men hang up
a number of fantastically carved figures of birds and fish. Some
of the figures of birds are quite ingeniously contrived, with movable
eyes, heads, and legs, and are able to flap their wings. Before
the fireplace there is a huge block wrapped up in dry grass. From
morning until night these carved figures are kept in motion by
means of strings, and during the whole time a chanting of songs
continues, while dry grass and weeds are burned to smoke the suspended
bladders. This fumigating process ends the day’s performances,
which are begun anew in the morning. In the evening
of that culminating day of this festival those strings of bladders are
taken down and carried by men upon painted sticks prepared for
the occasion; the women, with torches in their hands, accompany
them to the sea-shore. Arrived there, the bladders are tied to
sticks and weighted with stones, and finally thrown into the water,
where they are watched with the greatest interest to see how long
they float upon the surface. From the time of sinking and the
number of rings upon the water where a bladder has disappeared
the shamans prophesy success or misfortune in hunting during the
coming year.</p>

<p>A final memorial feast in honor of a distinguished ancestor is
conducted as follows:</p>

<p>Eight old men clad in parkas enter the kashga, or council-house,
each carrying a stone lamp, which they deposit around the fire-hole.
They next produce three small mats and spread them upon
the floor in three corners of the building, and from the spectators
three men are selected who are willing to go to the grave. The
three nearest relatives of the deceased then seat themselves on the
mats and divest themselves of all their clothing, wash their bodies,
and don new clothes, girding themselves with belts manufactured
several generations back and preserved as heirlooms in the family.
To each of these men a staff is given, and they advance together to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
the centre of the kashga, when the oldest among the invited guests
sends them forth to call the dead. These messengers leave the
building, followed by the givers of this feast. After an absence of
ten minutes the former return, and through the underground passage
the whole population of the village crowds in, from the old
and feeble down to children at the breast, and with them come the
masters of ceremonies, wearing long seal-skin gloves, and strings
of sea-parrot bills hanging about the breast and arms, with elaborate
belts nearly a foot in width, consisting of white bellies of
unborn fawns trimmed with wolverine tails. All such ornaments
are carefully preserved and handed down from generation to generation,
some of them being made of white sable—an exceedingly
rare skin—for which high prices are paid, as much as twenty or
thirty beavers or otters for one small skin. The women hold in
their hands one or two eagle-feathers, and tie around the head a
narrow strip of white sable. Each family, grouping itself behind
its own stone lamp, chants in turn in mournful measure a song composed
for the occasion. These songs are almost indefinitely prolonged
by inserting the names of all the relatives of the deceased,
living and dead. The singers stand motionless in their places, and
many of those present are weeping. When a “song of the dead”
is concluded the people seat themselves, and their usual feasting
and gorging ensues. The next morning, after a bath (indulged in
by all the males), the multitude again assembles in this kashga.
The chanting around the fire-hole is renewed in the same mournful
tone, until one old man seizes a bladder drum and takes the lead,
accompanied by a few singers, and followed in procession by all
participants in the feast. They walk slowly to every sepulchre in
succession, halting before each to chant a mourning song; all visitors
not belonging to the bereaved families in the meantime crowd
upon the sodded roofs of the houses and watch these proceedings.
In the evening all that remains of food in the village is set before
the people, and when every kantag is scraped of the last remnant
of its contents the feast is ended; then those visitors at once depart
for their homes.</p>

<p>Occasionally the giver of such a feast, desiring to do special
honor to the object of it, passes three days sitting naked upon a
mat in a corner of his kashga, without food or drink, chanting a
song in praise of a dead relative. At the end of such a fast any
or all visitors present gifts to him; the story of his achievement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>is carried abroad, and he is made famous for life among his
fellows.</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that many individuals give away
all their property on such occasions. If it happens that during
such a memorial feast a visitor arrives from a distant village who
bears the same name with the subject of a celebration, he is at
once overwhelmed with gifts, clothed anew from head to foot with
the most expensive garments, and returns to his home a wealthy
man.</p>

<p>The country in which the Innuit lives is one that taxes the utmost
hardihood of man when it is traversed by land or by sea. It
is not likely that it will ever be much frequented by white men—it
will remain to us as it has been to the Russians, an immense area
of desolate sameness, almost unknown to us, or to its savage occupants,
for that matter. The general contour of the great Alaskan
mainland interior is that of a vast undulating plain with high
rounded granitic hills and ridges scattered in all lines of projection;
on the flanks of which, and by its countless lakes and water-courses,
a growth, more or less abundant, of spruce, birch, willows, poplars,
and a large number of hardy shrubs, will be encountered. Its
summers are short, warm, and pleasant; its winters are long, and
bitterly cold and inclement.</p>

<p>The tundra, however, which fronts the whole of that extensive
coast-line of Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean, is indeed cheerless
and repellant at any season. In the summer it is a great flat swale,
full of bog-holes, shiny and decaying peat, innumerable sloughs,
shallow and stagnant, and from which swarms of malignant mosquitoes
rise to fairly torture and destroy a traveller unless he be
clad in a coat of mail. In the winter and early spring fierce gales
of wind at zero-temperature sweep over these steppes of Alaska in
constant succession, making travel exceedingly dangerous, and as
painful even as it is in the warmer months. During this period
of the year all approach to the coast is barred in Bering Sea by a
system of shoals and banks which extend so far seaward that a
vessel drawing only ten feet of water will be hard aground, beyond
the sight of land, sixty miles off the Yukon mouth.</p>

<p>At the head of the Bay of Bristol a small but deep and rapid
river empties a flood of pure, clear water into an intricate series of
sand and mud channels which belong there. The Kvichak is the
name of this stream, and it rises less than forty miles away in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
largest fresh-water lake known to Alaska—that inland sea of Ilyamna,
over ninety miles in its greatest length, varying in width
from fifteen to thirty. Those gusts and gales that sweep over its blue
waters raise a heavy surf which beats sonorously upon its pebbly
shores and under its cliffs, while the loud wailing cry of a great
northern loon<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> echoes from one lonely shore to the other when disturbed
by the unwonted passage of a native’s canoe. Against the
eastern horizon there springs from its bosom an abrupt and mighty
wall of Alpine peaks, which stand as an eternal barrier between
its pure sweet waters and the salt surges of the Pacific.</p>

<p>The ruins of an old Russian trading-post stand in the midst of
a small native village at the outlet of, and on the slope of, a lovely
grassy upland which rises from the lake. Its people are all living
in log houses like those we noticed in Cook’s Inlet; but nevertheless
they are true Innuits. The two other small hamlets on these Ilyamna
shores are all that exist. Their inhabitants live in the greatest
peace and solitary comfort that savages can understand. Two
trails over the divide are travelled by these natives, who trade with
the Cook’s Inlet people, and who range over the mountain sides in
pursuit of reindeer and of bears. A most noteworthy family of
Russian Creoles lived here on the first portage. The father was a
man of gigantic stature, and he reared four Anak-like sons, who
are, as he was, mighty hunters, and of great physical power. This
family lives all to itself in that beautiful wilderness of Ilyamna, a
little way back from the lake on a hillside, where they command
passes over to Cook’s Inlet. They control the trade of this entire
region and rule without a shadow of disputation.</p>

<p>A tragedy occurred in one of these small villages of Ilyamna,
which has been fitly memorized by the Russian Church. In 1796
a priest of the Greek faith came over from Kadiak, and, enchanted
by the scenery and pleased by a warm, kindly welcome received
from the natives, he determined to tarry here with them and save
their souls. He<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> was a man of the most handsome presence and
the sweetest address, and for a moment prevailed. Then, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
heathenish rites and festivals were postponed at his bidding, surly
shamans fomented seeds of hate and fear. Finally an hour
arrived when, at a preconcerted signal, the slumbering wrath of
the savages was aroused, and they fell upon and slew this unsuspecting
missionary and destroyed every vestige of his existence
among them. The cause of Father Juvenal’s death was his strong
opposition to polygamy. It is said that when he was attacked by
savages he neither fled nor did he defend himself, either of which
he might have successfully done; but he delivered himself unresistingly
into the hands of his murderers, asking only for the safety
of his subordinates, which was granted. The natives say, in their
recitation of the event, that after the monk had been struck down
and left by the mob as dead, he “rose up once more, walked towards
them, and spoke.” They fell upon him again, and again, and again,
for he repeated this miracle several times, until at last, in bewildered
fury, they literally cut him into pieces.</p>

<p>Reindeer cross and recross the Kvichak River in large herds
during the month of September, as they range over to and from
the Peninsula of Alaska, feeding, and also to escape from mosquitoes.
At the mouth of this stream is one of the broadest deer-roads
in the country. The natives run along the banks of the river
when reindeer are swimming across, easily and rapidly spearing
those unfortunate animals as they rise from the water, securing
in this way any number that fancy or want may dictate. At one
time a trader counted seven hundred deer-carcasses as they lay
here on the sands of the river’s margin, untouched save by a removal
of the hides; not a pound of that meat out of the thousands
putrefying had been saved by these lazy Innuits; who, improvident
wretches as they are, would be living, less than five months later, in
a state of starvation! But all this misery of famine in March will
have been forgotten again next September, when the same surplus
of food is within their reach, for they will not store up against the
morrow—the labor is too great—the shiftless sentiment of a savage
forbids that exertion.</p>

<p>There is a curious distinction drawn by nature between the
Siberian and Alaskan reindeer. Everybody is familiar with the
fact that on the Asiatic side these animals are domesticated and
serve as a mainstay and support of large tribes, both savage and
civilized. But the spirit of the Alaskan deer is such that it will not
live under the control of man, or even within his presence. If confined,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
it refuses food, and then perishes of self-imposed starvation.
The most patient and extended trials have been made at Nooshagak
by imported Kamschadales, who were raised to the life of deer-driving
over there; yet, in no instance whatsoever were these
experts able to overcome the difficulty and accustom those timid
animals to the sight, sound, and smell of man. The Alaskan species
is much larger than its Asiatic cousin, but otherwise resembles
it closely, being, if anything, more uniformly gray in tint and less
spotted with white over the back and head.</p>

<p>Reindeer have a most extended range in Alaska, where an immense
area of tundra and upland moors yield an abundance of
those mosses and lichens which they most affect. Innumerable
sloughs and lakes afford these deer a harbor of refuge from cruel torments
of mosquitoes, when the wind does not blow briskly in summer;
the wooded interior gives them shelter from the driving fury
of wintry snow-storms. Big brown bears follow in the wake of
travelling herds, and feed fat upon all sickly or weaker members
and imprudent fawns of the drove; so do wolves and wolverines;
and the lop-eared lynx is not missing.</p>

<p>Nooshagak is a trading centre for that entire Bristol Bay district,
which comprises the coast of Bering Sea from Cape Newenham,
in the north, to the peninsular extremity at Oonimak, in the
south—an immense expanse in which some four thousand Innuits
abide, and live largely upon fish and deer-meat. The Oogashik,
Igageek, Nakneek, Kvichak, Nooshagak, Igoosheek, and Togiak
Rivers all empty into this great shallow gulf. Up their swollen
channels, after an opening of the ice during the last half of May,
salmon run from the sea in irregular but constant travel until the
end of August. Inferior salmon run even as late as November,
while the various kinds of salmon-trout and white-fish exist under
the ice of deep streams and lakes all winter. By the middle of
September hard frosts in the mountains congeal all sources of innumerable
rivulets which have helped to swell the volume and
raise the level of a river’s summer flood, and then these streams
which we have just named begin to fall rapidly in their channels.
If we chance to travel anywhere along their banks at this time, we
will find them covered with windrows and heaps of dead salmon
two and three feet in height. The gravelly beaches of the lakes,
the bars and shoals of every stream, are then lined with decaying
and putrid bodies of these fish, while every overhanging bough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
and projecting rock is festooned with their rotting forms—ah!
the stench arising absolutely forbids the pangs of hunger, even
though we have no provision. These are the salmon that have died
from exhaustion and from bruises received in struggling with swift
and impetuous currents, and the rocks and snags that beset their
paths of annual reproduction.</p>

<p>North of the Togiak River are several small, rocky islets which,
having a nucleus of solid granite, are the cause of a large series
of sand and mud reefs. Upon those shoals the huge walrus of
Bering Sea is wont to crawl and lazily sun himself in herds of
thousands. He is practically secure here from attack, since the
varying shifts of the tide and its furious rush in ebb and flood
make a trip to the islets one of positive danger, even to a most
hardy and well-acquainted hunter. Stragglers, however, are frequently
surprised on the mainland shore opposite, and the southern
coast of Hagenmeister Island toward Cape Newenham to the
westward.</p>

<p>The muskrat catch of Alaska is secured almost wholly in the
Nooshagak region—an immense number of these water-rodents are
annually taken by Innuits here. Traders, however, do not prize them
very highly, but to secure the natives’ custom they are obliged to appear
satisfied with all that these people bring in to the post. These
skins are, however, not sold in this country; they are all shipped to
France and Germany, where they meet with a ready sale, since the
poor people there are not above wearing them. Also, most of the
good Alaskan beaver peltries are from this district, where they have
the best fur and are consequently prized above all other catches
outside of that region. Land-otter is also in large quantity and
fine quality, but the mink and martens and foxes are inferior.
During summer seasons, on many lakes, flocks of big, white,
trumpeting swans will be found frequenting nearly every one of
those bodies of water. The natives hunt them at night, and capture
unsuspecting birds as they sleep upon the water, by paddling
noiselessly upon them. The traders encourage this industry for
the sake of the swan’s down which it produces. The most favored
spot by swans is Lake Walker, which lies on the Nakneek portage
over to Cook’s Inlet. Perhaps its rare, unique beauty charms
these giant natatores as it does ourselves, for, without question, it
is incomparably the most lovely sheet of water, set in a frame of
glorious mountains, which the fancy of an artist could possibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
devise. It is an exceedingly fascinating spot, and language is utterly
inadequate to portray its vistas, which alternate from absolute
grandeur to that of quiet loveliness, as you sail around its pebbly
shores and yellow sands.</p>

<p>The immediate banks of the Nakneek River, through which
Lake Walker empties its surplus water into Bristol Bay, are low and
flat, and covered with a luxuriant growth of bushes, grasses, and
amphibious plants, semi-tropical in their verdant vigor of life.
The timber on hill-slopes that rise from the plain is principally
clumps of birch and poplar, quickly passing to solid masses of
spruce as a higher ascent is made to the rolling uplands and
mountain sides. An old, deserted settlement—ruins of Paugwik,
marked by the decayed outlines of its cemetery, still is visible at
the debouchure of the Nakneek. With a strange disrespect for the
departed, those natives who live at an adjoining village come over
here to excavate salmon-holes in that ancient graveyard, wherein they
place their fish-heads, so that a process of moist rotting shall take
place prior to eating them! The Innuits of Kenigayat have no fear
of the “witching hour of night” in this burial site of their ancestors.</p>

<p>The seal and walrus hunters of the Nooshagak district are those
hardy Innuits who live at Kulluk and Ooallikh Bays, in plain sight
of these walrus islets and shoals which we were taking notice of a
short time ago. The large mahklok and a smaller, but quaintly
marked “saddle-backed” seal are taken by these people in large
numbers every year. The oil is their great stock-in-trade, for those
fur-bearing animals that belong to the land here are away below par
when brought to a trader. The coast between their villages and
the mouth of the Togiak River is one of a most remarkable series
of bluffy headlands, seven of them, being all of sandstone which
has weathered into queer, fantastic pinnacles and towers, and is
washed at the sea-level into hundreds of huge caverns wherein the
surf beats with a noise like the distant roar of artillery. Screaming
flocks of water-fowl are breeding on their mural faces, and
troops of foxes lurk in the interstices, and roam incessantly for eggs
and unwary birds.</p>

<p>The Togiak River never was ascended by a white man until the
summer of 1880.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> It is a very remarkable region with respect to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>its people. Though the course of the river is only one hundred
miles in length, yet we find upon it seven villages (one of them very
large), having an aggregate population of 1,826 souls. No other one
section of Alaska has so dense a population with reference to its
inhabited area. The river is, however, a broad one, being a mile
and a half in width, shoal and shallow, with deep pools and eddies
here and there. Its banks are low, and the valley through which
it runs is low and flat, with extensive bottom-lands that widen
out at places to a distance of fifteen miles between the ridges
and hills which direct its short course. Upon these flats grow
most luxuriant and lofty grasses, high as the heads of natives—literally
concealing, as it were, the dense human occupation of its
extent.</p>

<p>The Togiaks are the Quakers of Alaska; they are the simplest
and the most unpretending of all her people; they seem to live entirely
to themselves, wholly indifferent as to what other folks have
and they have not. They seldom ever view a white man, and then it
is only when they go down to the river’s mouth and visit a trader
in his sloop or schooner. He never goes up to see them, for the best
of reasons to him—they never have anything fit for barter save a
few inferior mink and ground-squirrel skins to trade. They have
no chiefs; each family is a law unto itself, and it comes and goes
with a sort of free and easy abandon that must resemble the life
and habit of primeval time. What little these people want and cannot
get from each other, they do not go farther in search of, but
do without, unless it be small supplies of tobacco which they procure
through other Innuits, second or third hand.</p>

<p>Entire families of them, during the summer, leave their winter
huts and go out into the valley at such points as their fancy may
indicate, where they pass two and three months with absolutely no
shelter whatever erected during that entire lapse of time. When it
rains hard they simply turn their skin boats bottom side up, stick
their heads under, and consider themselves fully settled for protection
from tempestuous wind and sleet-storms, or any other climatic
unpleasantness. How insensible to extremes of weather do these
bodies of the Innuits become—their whole external form is as insensible
to heat or cold as their stolid features are! Were they
living under Italian skies, they could not affect a greater disregard
for the varying moods of that mild climate than they do for the
chilly, boisterous weather of Alaska. The Togiakers never go far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
from the river upon which they build their rude winter villages, and
never venture out from its mouth; hence they are not so happy in
making the skin canoe or kayak, as their hardier brethren are:
these boats on the Togiak are clumsy, broad of beam in proportion
to length, and the hatch, or hole, so large that two persons can sit
in it back to back. When a family concludes to go out for the
summer camp, the man gets into his “kayak,” takes the children
who are under four or five years in with him, then pulls and paddles
his way up against the current, or floats down, as the case may
be; the women—wife, mother, and daughters—are turned ashore
and obliged to find their way up or down through long grass and
over quaking bogs—to toil in this manner from camp to camp,
and as they plod along they shout and sing at the top of their
voices to apprise any bear or bears, which may be in their path, of
such coming, and thus stampede them; otherwise they would be
in continual danger of silently stepping upon bruin as he lurked or
slept in dense grassy jungles. When a bear first takes notice of
the approach of a human being it invariably slinks away, rarely
ever displaying, by the faintest sound, its departure; but that same
animal, if surprised suddenly at close quarters, will turn and fight
desperately, even unto death.</p>

<p>The bold, far-projected headland of Cape Newenham forms the
southern pier of that remarkable funnel-like sea-opening to the
Kuskokvim River—a river upon which the human ichthyophagi of
the north do most congregate: three thousand savages are living
here in a string of scattered hamlets that closely adjoin each other,
and are nearly all located on the right-hand bank of the river as we
ascend it. They are more like muskrat villages than human habitations—water,
water all around and everywhere: situated on little
patches, or narrow dikes, at the rim of the high tides, on the edge
of the river proper, which is here, and for a long distance up, bordered
by a strikingly desolate and forlorn country. A glance at
our map will show to the reader that great funnel-fashioned mouth
of the Kuskokvim, through which its strong and turbid, clay-white
current is discharged into Bering Sea. The tides, in this enormous
estuary, run with a rise and fall that simply beggars description—reaching
an amazing vertical flow and ebb of fifty feet at the entrance!
Such extraordinary change in tide-level is carried up, but
much modified as it progresses, until lost at Mumtrekhlagamute;
the entire physical aspect of that region, in which this sweeping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>daily change in a level of the water prevails, is most repellant and
discouraging.</p>

</figure>

<p>From the high-tide bank-rims of the Kuskokvim, as we go up,
across to the hills and to their rear in the east, extends a dreary
expanse of swale and watered moors forty to sixty miles in width,
flat and low as the surface of the sea itself. At high tide it appears
to be nearly all submerged. It shimmers then like an inland ocean
studded with myriads of small mossy islets. Again, when the tide
in turn runs out, great far-expanded flats of mud and ooze supplant
the waters everywhere, giving in this abrupt manner a striking
shift of scenic effect. The eastern river bank is a queer, natural
dike, formed by a rank and vigorous growth of coarse sedges, bulrushes,
and little sapling fringes of alders, willows, with birch and
poplars interspersed. Upon this natural dike these native villages
range in close continuity, each occupying all the dry land in its own
immediate limits, and occupying it so thoroughly that a traveller
cannot, without great difficulty, find bare land enough outside of
their sites upon which to pitch his tent. Mud, mud everywhere—a
whitish-clay silt, through which, at low tide, it is almost a physical
impossibility to walk from a stranded bidarka up to the villages.
Indeed, if you are unfortunate enough to reach a settlement
here when coming down or going up the river as the tide is out,
you are a wise man if you simply fold your arms, sit quietly in your
cramped position until the rising, roaring flood returns and carries
you forward and over to your destination.</p>

<p>On the Lower Kuskokvim the river width of itself is so great
that the people living on its eastern banks never can see an opposite
shore to the westward, for it is even more submerged there and
swampy, if anything, than where they reside; hence we find them
located here on the east bank, to a practical exclusion of all settlement
over on those occidental swales and bogs. The current of
this singular stream flows quite rapidly. It discharges a great
volume of water, which is colored a peculiar whitish tone by the
contribution of a roiled tributary that heads in the Nooshagak
divide. At its source and down to this muddy junction it is clear.
It is a rapid stream in the narrows, and dull and sluggish in flow
through wide openings.</p>

<p>The density of aboriginal population so remarkably manifested
as we observe it on the Lower Kuskokvim does not, however, give
all the testimony, inasmuch as during every summer two thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
or more natives from the Yukon delta come over here to fish with
the Kuskokvims, making a sum-total of six or seven thousand fish-eaters,
who catch, consume, and waste an astonishing quantity of
salmon, which would, if properly handled, be sufficient to handsomely
feed the entire number of native inhabitants of Alaska,
four times over, every year!</p>

<p>Snow lies deeply upon all this region, driven and packed in vast
drifts and fields by the wrath of furious wintry gales, and the hunting
of land animals is thus made impossible. Then a native of the
Kuskokvim Valley turns his attention to trapping white-fish<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> just
as soon as the ice becomes firmly established, usually early in November.
The traps are made of willow and alder wicker-work, and
nearly all in the same pattern as those employed for salmon, but of
somewhat smaller dimensions, so as to be easier to handle, since
they are not required to catch the huge “chowichie.” Every morning
at dawn on the river the men of its many villages can be seen
making their way out to these fish-traps, when it is not bitterly
inclement, and even then, sometimes. They carry curiously shaped
ice-picks, made or fashioned from walrus-teeth or deer-antlers, because
every night’s freezing covers the trap anew with a solid cap
of ice, which must be broken up and removed ere a savage can get
at it, haul it out, and empty its “pot.” Think of the physical hardihood
required of a man who goes out from his hut to visit such
a trap when the wind, away below zero, is blowing over an icy
plain of the broad river at the rate of sixty miles an hour, whirling
snowy spiculæ, like hot shot, into the faintest exposure which he
dares to make of his face or eyes! He does not often go when a
“poorga” prevails in this boisterous manner. Sometimes he feels
as though he must, since a storm may have raged in wild, bitter
fury for a week without sign of abatement. His children or his
wife may be sick and half-starved; then, only then, does he venture
out to dare and endure the greatest hardship of savage life in
Alaska.</p>

<p>It frequently happens after an unusually cold night that a trap,
including its contents, is frozen solid. This is another dreaded
accident, for it involves great labor, since the trap itself must be
picked to pieces and built anew. In spite of all these difficulties,
the natives get enough fresh fish during each winter by such method<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
to eke out their scanty store of dried salmon and save themselves
from starvation. On the lower river course, within the influence
of that tremendous tidal action which has been described, a solid
covering of ice never envelops the surface of the Kuskokvim. Here
the natives hunt seals, the mahklok, and also the white whale or
beluga, which furnishes them a full supply of oil<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and blubber. A
school of belugas puff and snort, like a fleet of tug-boats, as they
push between and under tide-broken masses of ice in hot pursuit
of fish that abound all over the broad estuary.</p>

<p>There is one particularly distressing and hideous feature that
belongs to this entire area of the Alaskan coast tundra and marshy
moors of the interior and its forests, its river-margins, and, in fact,
to every place except those spots where the wind blows hard. It is
the curse of mosquitoes—the incessant stinging of swarms of these
blood-thirsty insects, which come out from their watery pupæ by
May 1st (with the earliest growing of spring vegetation), and remain
in perfect clouds until withered and destroyed by severe frosts in
September and October. The Indians themselves do not dare to
go into the woods at Kolmakovsky during the summer, and the very
dogs themselves frequently die from effects of mere mosquito-biting
about their eyes and paws only, for that thick woolly hair of these
canines effectually shields all other portions of their bodies. Close-haired
beasts, like cattle or horses, would perish here in a single
fortnight at the longest, if not protected by man.</p>

<p>Universal agreement in Alaska credits the Kuskokvim mosquito<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
as being the worst. They do not appear elsewhere in the same
number or ferocity, but they are quite unendurable at the best
and most-favored stations. Breeding here, as they do, in these
vast extents of tundra sloughs and woodland swamps, they are able
to rally around and embarrass an explorer beyond all reasonable
description. Language is simply inadequate to portray that misery
and annoyance which the Alaskan mosquito-swarms inflict upon
us in the summer, whenever we venture out from the shelter of
trading-posts, where mosquito-bars envelop our couches and cross
the doors and windows to our living-room. Naturally, it will be
asked, What do the natives do? They, too, are annoyed and suffer;
but it must be remembered that their bodies are daily anointed with
rancid oil, and certain ammoniacal vapors constantly arise from their
garments which even the mosquito, venomous and cruel as it is,
can scarcely withstand the repellant power of. When the natives
travel in this season, they gladly avail themselves, however, of any
small piece of mosquito-netting that they can secure, no matter how
small. Usually they have to wrap cloths and skins about their
heads, and they always wear mittens in midsummer. The traveller
who exposes his bare face at this time of the year on the Kuskokvim
tundra or woodlands will speedily lose his natural appearance; his
eyelids swell up and close; his neck expands in fiery pimples, so
that no collar that he ever wore before can now be fastened around
it, while his hands simply become as two carbuncled balls. Bear
and deer are driven into the water by these mosquitoes. They are
a scourge and the greatest curse of Alaska.</p>

<p>Two hundred miles up from the Kuskokvim mouth is a focal
centre of the trade in this district. It is Kolmakovsky, established
by the Russians in 1839. It consists of seven large, roughly built
frame dwellings and log warehouses, and a chapel, which stand on
a flat, timbered mesa well above the river, on its right or southern
shore. Here the current of the stream has narrowed, and flows
between high banks over a gravelly bed. These terraces, which
rise from the water, are flat-topped, and covered with a tall growth
of spruce. Mossy tundras and grassy meadows roll in between
forest patches. The timber is much larger here than it is anywhere
else in the great Alaskan interior, and that scenery along
this river is far wilder and more agreeable than any which is so
monotonous and characteristic of the Upper Yukon. The desolate
flatness and muddy wastes of the Lower Kuskokvim are now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>replaced by this pleasing change, which we have just mentioned, a
short distance below Kolmakovsky.</p>

<p class="fs90">Old Russian trading-post, established in 1839, two hundred miles up the River: these houses were once surrounded with a stockade, but
such a defence has long been needless. This view is taken from the opposite bank of the River, looking over to the high hills of the Nooshagak
divide, and Mount Tamahloopat in the distance</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Back of that post, and clearly defined against the horizon, are
the snowy-capped summits of those mountains that form a Nooshagak
divide. One of them rises in an oval-pointed crest to a very
considerable elevation<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
above all the rest, and is the landmark of
every traveller who comes over the Yukon divide to Kolmakov.
The river here, as it brawls swiftly in its course, is about seven
hundred feet in width, with bends above and below where it expands
to fully twice that distance.</p>

<p>While the Kuskokvim is the only considerable rival of the Yukon
in this whole Alaskan country, yet when seriously contrasted with
the great Kvichpak<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> itself, then the Kuskokvim bears about the
same resemblance to it that the Ohio River does to the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Kolmakovsky marks the limit of inland migration allotted to
the Innuit race on its banks, who are not permitted by those Tinneh
tribes of the interior to advance farther up the river. It is also
removed from that disagreeable influence of Bering Sea, where the
prevalence of rain and of furious protracted gales of wind make life
a burden to a white man on the Lower Kuskokvim. Its environing
forests break the force of these storms, and there is also less
fog, so that the sun usually shines out clear and hot, especially in
July and August.</p>

<p>In the winter season, when frost has locked up miry swales and
swamps, and snow lies in deep, limitless drifts, a white hunter at
Kolmakov can join the Kuskokvamoots in trailing and shooting
giant moose which come down from the mountains of the Nooshagak
divide. This animal is quickly apprehended by the native
dogs, so that whenever winter weather will permit, a native Innuit
spends most of his time, not employed by ice-fishing on the Kuskokvim,
in this sport.</p>

<p>The fur-trade at Kolmakovsky is quite active, but it is almost exclusively
transacted with a few Indians up the river, and not with
the numerous Innuits below. The latter are, commercially speaking,
very poor, having not much of anything but little stores of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
“mahklok” seal-oil. These big phocaceans are almost as great
fishermen as the Innuits are themselves, and find the mouth of the
Kuskokvim as attractive as it is to their human foes. In this frame
of mind the mahklok ventures on to those tidal banks of the estuary
below, and this rash habit enables the natives to capture a great
many of them there every year. Those Innuits below Kolmakovsky
have no land-furs whatever, save a few inferior mink-skins; but
they trade their surplus seal-oil with the Indians above and on the
Yukon for that ground-squirrel parka and tanned moose-skin shirt
which they universally wear. There is an exceeding rankness to
an odor of rancid fish-oil, but the aroma from a bag of putrescent
seal-oil is simply abominable and stifling to a Caucasian nose—an
acrid funk, which pervades everything, and hangs to it for an indefinite
length of time afterward in spite of every effort made to disinfect.</p>

<p>The Indians of the Upper Kuskokvim were once said to be a
very numerous tribe; but the severity of successive cold winters
has so destroyed them, as a people, that to-day they exist there as
a feeble remnant only of what they once were. An intelligent
trader, Sipari, who has traversed their entire country, in 1872-76,
declares that “forty tents,” or one hundred souls is an ample enumeration
of their number.</p>

<p>The Innuits of the Lower Kuskokvim are much better physical
specimens of humanity than are those of their race living on the
Lower Yukon. These latter are called by all traders the most
clumsy and degraded of Alaskan savages. The portage from Kolmakovsky
to the Kvichpak is only three days’ journey in winter, or
five days by water in canoes, during summer. It is a trip made by
large numbers of the natives of both streams, in the progress of
their natural barter and moose-hunting.</p>

<p>The forests of the Kuskokvim and the Nooshagak mountains
and uplands are frequently swept by terrible conflagrations, which
utterly destroy whole areas of timber as far as the eye can reach.
This ruin of fire, of course, absolutely extinguishes all trapping for
any fur-bearing animal hitherto found in those <em>brulé</em> tracts, and entails
much privation upon the natives who have been accustomed to
gain their best livelihood largely by hunting in those sections. A
burnt district presents a desolate front for years after; the fire
does not, in its swift passage, do more, at first, than burn the foliage
and smaller limbs of trees in a dense spruce forest; but it
roasts the bark and kills a trunk, so that all sap-circulation is forever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
at an end in it. As the years roll by, these trunks gradually bleach
out to almost a grayish white, the charred, blackened bark is all
weathered off, and gradually such trees fall, as they decay at the
stump, in every conceivable direction upon the ground, across one
another, like so many jack-straws, making a perfectly impassable
barricade to human travel without tedious labor. A brisk growth
of small poplars, birch, and willow springs up in place of the original
spruce forest, but none of these trees and shrubs ever grow to
any great size. At rare intervals a young evergreen is seen to rise
in sharp relief, towering over all deciduous shrubbery, and in the
lapse of long years it will succeed in supplanting every growing
thing around with its own kind again.</p>

<p>The traders at Kolmakovsky make up their furs into snug bales
and descend the river in wooden and skin boats, every June, to a
point below, about one hundred and fifty miles, where they meet
their respective schooners, or go still lower to an anchorage of
larger vessels, and renew their annual supplies. These river-boats
are then poled and rope-walked up the river back to the post. The
principal trade here is beaver, red foxes, mink, marten, land-otter,
and brown and black bears.</p>

<p>The traders say it is exceedingly seldom that a white man
ever comes in contact with the natives of the Lower Kuskokvim,
and that there is nothing to call them there; also, that the labors
of the Russian missionaries of the Yukon never extended to this region,
though their registers and reports show quite a number of
Christians on the Kuskokvim River. The only trace of Christianity
among this tribe, outside of the immediate vicinity of a trading-station<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
with its chapel, consists of a few scattered crosses in
burial-places adjoining the settlement. At the village of Kaltkhagamute,
within three days’ travel of the Russian mission on the
Yukon, a graveyard there contains a remarkable collection of grotesquely
carved monuments and memorial posts, indicating very
clearly the predominance of old pagan traditions over such faint
ideas of Christianity as may have been introduced for these people.
Among monuments in this place the most remarkable is that
of a female figure with four arms and hands, resembling closely a
Hindoo goddess, even to its almond eyes and a general cast of
features. Natural hair is attached to its head, falling over the
shoulders. The legs of this figure are crossed in true oriental style,
and two of the hands, the lower pair, hold rusty tin plates, upon
which offerings of tobacco and scraps of cotton prints have been
deposited. The whole is protected by a small roof set upon posts.</p>

<p>Other burial posts are scarcely less remarkable in variety of feature
and coloring, and the whole collection would afford a rich harvest
of specimens to any museum. Nearly all these figures are
human effigies, though grotesque and misshapen, and drawn out of
proportion. No images of animals or birds, which would have indicated
the existence of totems and clans in the tribe, were to be
seen; but here and there, over apparently neglected graves, a stick,
surmounted by a very rude carving of a fish, a deer, or a beluga, indicative
of the calling of the deceased hunter, could be discovered.</p>

<p>Petroff, who has made the only hand-to-hand examination ever
conducted, by a white man, of the people of the Lower Kuskokvim,
says that they resemble in outward appearance their Eskimo
neighbors in the north and west, but their complexion is perhaps a
little darker. The men are distinguished from those of other Innuit
tribes by having more hair on the faces; mustaches being
quite common, even with youths of from twenty to twenty-five,
while in other tribes this hirsute appendage does not make its appearance
until the age of thirty-five or forty. Their hands and feet
are small, but both sexes are muscular and well developed, inclined
rather to embonpoint. In their garments they differ but little from
their neighbors hitherto described, with an exception of the male
upper garment, or parka, which reaches down to the feet, even
dragging a little upon the ground, making it necessary to gird it
up for purposes of walking. The female parkas are a little shorter.
Both garments are made of the skins of ground-squirrels, ornamented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>with pieces of red cloth and bits of tails of that rodent. The
women wear no head-covering except in the depth of winter, when
they pull the hoods of reindeer parkas over their heads. The men
wear caps, made of the skin of an Arctic marmot, resembling in shape
those famous Scotch “bonnets,” so commonly worn by Canadians.</p>

<p>Many young men wear a small band of fur around the head,
into which they insert eagle and hawk-feathers on festive occasions.
A former custom of this tribe, of inserting thin strips of bone or
the quills of porcupines through an aperture cut in the septum,
seems to have become obsolete, though the nasal slit can still be
seen on all grown male individuals. Their ears are also universally
pierced for an insertion of pendants, but these seem at present to
be worn by children only, who discard them as they grow up. In
fact, all ornamentation in the shape of beads, shells, etc., appears to
be lavished upon their little ones, who toddle about with pendants
rattling from ears, nose, and lower lip, and attired in frocks stiff
with embroidery of beads or porcupine-quills, while the older girls
and boys run almost naked, and the parents themselves are imperfectly
protected against cold and weather by a single fur garment.</p>

<p>The use of the true Eskimo kayak is universal among the Kuskokvagmute,
but in timbered regions of the upper river, in the
vicinity of Kolmakovsky, the birch-bark canoe also is quite common.
The latter, however, is not used for extended voyages or for
hunting, but is reserved chiefly for attending to fish-traps, for the
use of women in their berrying and fishing expeditions, and for
crossing rivers and streams.</p>

<p>The only indigenous fruit which this large population of the
Lower Kuskokvim can enjoy is that of the pretty little “moroshkie,”
or red raspberry,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> which grows in great abundance on its short,
tiny stalks throughout all swales and over rolling tundra. These
berries are saturated in rancid oil, however, before they are eaten
to any great extent, being air-dried first and pressed into thin cakes;
then, as wanted, they are pounded up in mortars and boiled, or
simply thrown into a wooden basin (or kantag) of oil. Then the
fingers, or rude horn spoons, are dipped in by happy feeders, who
apparently relish this ill-savored combination just as keenly as one
of our Gothamitic gourmands appreciates the flavor of a Chesapeake
terrapin stewed in champagne.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Is it not a little singular that the lonely and monotonous course of
the Yukon River, reaching as it does to the very limits of the pathless
interior of a vast, unexplored region on either side, should be
that one section of all others in Alaska the best known to us? An
almost uninterrupted annual march has been made up and down
its dreary banks since 1865, by men<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> well qualified to describe its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
varying moods and endless shoals—every turn in its flood, every
shelving bank of alluvium or rocky bluff that lines the margin of
its turbid current, has been minutely examined, named and renamed
to suit the occasion and character of a traveller.</p>

<p>The Yukon River is not reached by traders as any other stream
of size is in Alaska, by sailing into its mouth. No ocean-going
craft can get within sixty miles of its deltoid entrance. Were a
sailor foolhardy enough to attempt such a thing, he would be hard
aground, in soft silt or mud, a hundred miles from land in a
direct line from the point of his destination. Therefore it is the
habit of mariners to sail up as far north as Norton’s Sound, and
then turn a little to the southward and anchor their schooners or
steamers under a lee of Stuart’s and St. Michael’s Islands, where
the old post of Michaelovsky is established on the latter.</p>

<p>The “Rédoute Saint Michael” was founded here in 1835 by
Lieutenant Tebenkov, and has been ever since, and is to-day, the
most important post in the Alaskan North. This post is a shipping
point for the accumulated furs gathered by all traders from
the Lower and Upper Yukon, and the Tannanah, the annual yield
from such points being the largest and the most valuable catch of
land-furs taken in Alaska. A vessel coming into St. Michael’s at any
time during the summer will find, encamped around its warehouses
many bands of Innuits and Indians who have come in there,
over long distances of hundreds of miles, from the north, east, and
south. They are there as traders and middlemen. The fur-trading
on the Yukon is very irregular as to its annual time and place—the
traders constantly moving from settlement to settlement, because
this year they may get only a thousand skins where they got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
five thousand last season, and <em>vice versa</em>. It is impossible to locate
the best single spots for trade; the catch in different sections will
vary every winter according to the depth of snow, the severity of
climate, the prevalence of forest fires, or starvation of whole villages,
owing to unwonted absence of fish, and so on.</p>

<p>In midsummer the Yukon is reached by small, light-draft, stern-wheel
steamers, which, watching their opportunity, run down from
St. Michael’s and enter its mouth, towing behind them a string of
five or six large wooden boats which are each laden with several
tons of merchandise. The scream of their whistles and puffing of
these little trading-steamers as they slowly drag such tows against
a rapid current, is the only enlivenment which the immense lonely
solitudes of the Yukon are subjected to by our people. That area
of watery waste is so wide and long, and the boats are so small and
few in number, that even this innovation must be watched for every
year with a hawk’s eye, or it will pass unobserved.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p4140_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p4140_ill.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">Trader’s Steamer towing Bateaux laden with Goods up the Yukon.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">[<em>The Kvichpak just below Mercier’s Station.</em>]</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The waters of the Kvichpak are discharged into Bering Sea
through a labyrinth of blind, misleading channels, sloughs, and
swamps, which extend for more than one hundred miles up until
they unite near Chatinak with the main channel of that great river.
This enormous deltoid mouth of the Yukon is a most mournful and
depressing prospect. The country itself is scarcely above the level
of tides, and covered with a monotonous cloak of scrubby willows
and rank sedges. It is water, water—here, there, and everywhere—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
vast inland sea filled with thousands upon thousands of swale
islets scarcely peeping above its surface. Broader and narrower
spaces between low delta lands are where the whirl of its current
is strongly marked by a rippling rush and the drift-logs that it
carries upon its muddy bosom. These are the channels, the paths
through the maze that leads from the sea up to the river proper;
and where they unite, at a point above Andrievsky and Chatinak,
the Yukon has a breadth of twenty miles; and again, at many
places, away on and up this impressive stream as far as seven or
eight hundred miles beyond, this same great width will be observed,
but the depth is very much decreased.</p>

<p>Myriads of breeding geese, ducks, and wading water-fowl resort
to this desolation of the deltoid mouth of the Yukon, where, in
countless pools and the thick covers of tall grass and sedge, they
are provided with a most lavish abundance of food and afforded
the happiest shelter from enemies; but the stolid Innuit does not
affect the place. The howling wintry gales and frightful curse of
mosquitoes in the summer are too much even for him. His people
live in only six or seven small wretched hamlets below Andrievsky
and Chatinak—less than five hundred souls in all, including the entire
population found right on the coast of the delta, between Pastolik
in the north and Cape Romiantzov on the south. Above
Anvik on the main river the Innuit does not like to go. He has no
love for those Indians who claim that region all to themselves and
resent his appearance on the scene. Whenever he does, however,
he is always in company with the traders, and he never gets out of
their sight and protection, even when making that overland portage
from St. Michael’s by the Oonalakleet trail.</p>

<p>As we emerge from those dreary, low and watery wastes of the
delta at Chatinak, the bluffs there, though desolate enough themselves,
with their rusty barren slopes, yet they give us cheerful assurance
of the fact that all Alaska is not under water, and that the
borders of its big river are at last defined on both sides. High rolling
hills come down boldly on the left bank as we ascend; but the
right shore is still low and but little removed from the flatness of a
swale. The channel of the river now zigzags from side to side (in
the usual way of running bodies of water which wash out and
undermine), building up bars and islets, and sweeping in its resistless
flood an immense aggregate of soil and timber far into Bering
Sea. The alluvial banks, wherever they are lifted above this surging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
current, which runs at an average rate of eight miles an hour, are
continually caving down, undermined, and washed away. So sudden
and precipitate are these landslides, sometimes, that they have almost
destroyed whole trading expeditions of the Russians and natives, who
barely had time to escape with their lives as the earthy avalanches
rolled down upon the river’s edge and into its resistless current.</p>

<p>Above the delta large spruce and fir-trees, aspens, poplars, and
plats of alders and willows grow abundantly on the banks; but
they do not extend far back from the river on either side into any portions
of the country, which is low and marshy, and which embraces
so large a proportion of the entire landscape. Small larch-trees are
also interspersed. The river is filled with a multitude of long, narrow
islands, all timbered as the banks are, and which are connected
one with the other by sand and gravel bars, that are always dry and
fully exposed at low-water stages. Immense piles of bleached and
splintered drift-logs are raised on the upper ends of these islands,
having lodged there at intervals when high water was booming
down.</p>

<p>Between Anvik and Paimoot are many lofty clay cliffs, entirely
made up of clean, pure earth of different bright colors—red, yellow,
straw-colored, and white, with many intermediate shades. The
Yukon runs down from its remote sources at the Stickeen divide
in British Columbia, down through a wild, semi-wooded country, a
succession of lakes and lakelets, through a region almost devoid of
human life. That extensive area, wherein we find such scant or utter
absence of population, is, south of the Yukon, very densely timbered
with spruce-trees on the mountains, and with poplars, birch,
willow, along the courses of the stream and margins of the lakes.
Its immediate recesses only are occasionally penetrated by roving
parties of Indian hunters, who now and then leave the great river
and the Tannanah for that purpose. It is a silent, gloomy wilderness.
To the northward of the Yukon this variety in timber still
continues; indeed, it reaches as far into the Arctic Circle and toward
the ocean there as the seaward slopes of those low and rolling
mountains extend, which rise in irregular ridges trending northeast
and southwest. These hills are between one hundred and one hundred
and fifty miles from the banks of the Kvichpak. Beyond this
divide and water-shed of the northern tributaries of the Yukon a
forest seldom appears in any case whatsoever, except where a low,
straggling spur of hills stretches itself down to the shores of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
icy sea; but it is stunted and scant in its hyperborean distribution
thereon.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to enter into a description of the appearance
and disposition of these Yukon Indians who live on this great river
above Anvik, since they resemble those savages which we are so
familiar with in the British American interior, Oregon, and Dakota.</p>

<p>The Russians, in regarding them, at once took notice of their
marked difference from the more stolid Innuits, so that they were
styled, jocularly, by Slavonian pioneers, “Frenchmen of the North,”
and “Gens de Butte.” The Innuits called them “Ingaleeks,” and
that is their general designation on the river to-day. They differ
from our Plain Indians in this respect only: they are all dog-drivers.
They rely upon the river and its tributaries largely for
food, using birch-bark canoes—no skin-boats whatever. They have
an overflowing abundance of natural food-supply of flesh, and fowl
also, and when they suffer, as they often do, from starvation, it is
due entirely to their own startling improvidence during seasons of
plenty, which occur every year. A decided infusion of Innuit blood
will be observed in the faces of the Indians who live at Anvik, and
some distance up the river from that point of landed demarcation
between Innuit and Ingaleek. In olden times the latter were wont
to raid upon the settlements of the former, and carried off Innuit
women into captivity whenever they could do so, treating the Eskimo
just as the Romans raped the Sabines.</p>

<p>An Innuit is not thrifty at all, but when brought into comparison
with the Indian he is a bright and shining light in this respect.
Among the Ingaleeks of the Yukon a spring famine regularly
prevails every year during the months of April and May, or until
the ice breaks up and the salmon run. One would naturally think
that the bitter memories of gnawing hunger endured for weeks before
an arrival of abundant food, would stimulate that savage to
glad exertion when it did arrive so as to lay by of such abundance
enough to insure him and his family against recurring starvation
next year. Strange to say, it does not. The fish come; the famished
natives gorge themselves, and thus engorged, loaf and idle
that time away which should be employed in drying and preserving
at least sufficient to keep them in stock when the fish have left the
stream. Often we will actually see them lazily going to their
slender store which they have newly prepared, and eat thereof,
while salmon are still running in the river at their feet! Such improvidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
and reckless disregard of the need of the morrow is
hard indeed for us to realize. Many of the beasts of the field and
forest with which the savage is well acquainted set him annually,
but in vain, a better example.</p>

<p>White traders during the last twenty years have so thoroughly
traversed the course of the Yukon, and, since our control of Alaska,
little stern-wheel steamers annually make trips from the sea, accompanied
with retinues of white men—these incidents have thoroughly
familiarized the Indians here with ourselves. But the wilder Ingaleeks
of the Tannanah, only six or seven hundred souls in number,
however, are as yet comparatively unknown to us. With an
exception of a white trader’s visit to their country in 1875,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and
the recent descent of the Tannanah by a plucky young officer of
the United States Army,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> these Koltchanes have been unknown
at home and wholly undisturbed by us. There are less than
sixteen hundred Indians living over the entire Yukon region—a
fact which speaks eloquently for an exceeding scantiness of the
population of that vast landed expanse of this interior of the Alaskan
mainland—a great arctic moor north of the Kvichpak, which
is a mere surface of slightly thawed swale, swampy tundra, lakes
and pools, sloughs and sluggish rivers, in the summer solstice,
while the wildest storms of frigid winds, laden with snow and
sleet, career in unchecked fury over them during winter. Such an
extreme climate is the full secret of its marked paucity of human
life. But that desolation of winter does not prevent an immense
migration of animal life to this repellant section every summer from
the south. Myriads of water-fowl, such as geese, ducks, and the
smaller forms, breed and moult here then in all security, and free
from molestation, while great herds of reindeer troop over the
lichen-bearing ridges. The musk-ox, however, has never been
known to range here or anywhere in Alaska within the memory of
man. Its fossil remains have been disinterred from the banks of
the Yukon, at several places (just as those of the mammoth have),
but that, with a few bleached skulls, is the only record of this
animal we can find which we would most naturally anticipate meeting
with on such ground, apparently so well adapted for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span></p>

<p>There is some difference of opinion as to whether the Yukon or
the Mississippi is the larger river, with respect to the volume of
their currents. The variation in this regard can hardly be very
great, either one way or the other. The Tannanah is the Missouri
of the Kvichpak, and swells the flood of that river very perceptibly
below its junction.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">Michaeiovsky.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">[<em>Extreme northern settlement of white Americans.</em>]</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Michaeiovsky has been, and will continue to be, the chief rendezvous
of a small white residency of the Alaskan North. It is
an irregularly built <em>omnium</em> of old Russian dwellings, warehouses,
and a few of our own structure. The stockade which once encircled
it has long ago been dispensed with, though the antique bastions
and old brass cannon still stand at one or two corners as they
stood in early times, well placed to overawe and intimidate a bold
and hostile savage people then surrounding them. The buildings are
clustered together on a small peninsula of an island, about twenty-five
or thirty feet above high-water mark; littered all around them
are the small outbuildings and the summer tents of Innuit and
Indian tourists who are loitering about for the double purpose of
gratifying a little curiosity, and of trading. An abundance of drift-wood
from the Yukon lies stranded on the beaches, and a large pile
of picked, straight logs have been hauled from the water and stacked
upon one side of a slope. The whole country, hill and plain, in
every direction from this post is a flat and alternately rolling moorland,
or tundra, the covering of which is composed principally of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
mosses and lichens, and a sphagnous combination which produces
in the short growing season a yellowish-green carpet, with patches
of pale lavender gray where the lichens are most abundant. At
sparse and irregular intervals bunches of coarse sedge grasses rise,
and the entire surface of moor is crossed at various angles with
lines of dwarf birches and an occasional clump of alders and
stunted willows. The most attractive feature in such an arctic landscape,
when summer has draped it as we now behold it, is the nodding
seed-plumes of the equisetum grasses—they are tufts of a pure,
fleecy white that, ruffled in the breeze, light up the sombre russet
swales with an almost electrical beauty. Everywhere here, in
less than eighteen inches or two feet beneath this blossoming flora,
will be found a solid foundation of perpetual frost and ice—it never
thaws lower. The flowers of that tundra embrace a list of over
forty beautiful species, chief among them being phloxes, a pale-blue
iris, white and yellow poppies, several varieties of the red-flowered
saxifrages, the broad-leaved archangelica, and many delicately
fronded ferns.</p>

<p>Twittering, darting flocks of barn-swallows hover and glide over
the old faded roofs and walls of Michaelovsky, and the bells of a
red-painted church, just beyond, come jangling sweetly across the
water, mingled with that homelike chattering of these swallows.
But a pious mission here is a practical failure in so far as any effect
upon the Innuit mind is concerned. During summer-time, in the
Upper Yukon country, thunder-showers are very common; down
here, on the coast, they are never experienced. The glory, however,
of an auroral display is divided equally between them, when
from September until March luminous waves and radii of pulsating
rose, purple, green, and blue flames light up and dance about the
heavens—gorgeous arches of yellow bands and pencil-points of
crimson fire are hung and glitter in the zenith. These exhibitions
beggar description; they are weirdly and surpassingly beautiful,
far beyond all comparison with anything else of a spectacular nature
on earth.</p>

<p>In the autumn and in the early days of December, a low declination
of the sun tints up the clouds at sunrise and sunset into
beautiful masses of colors that rapidly come and go in their origination
and fading. Twilight is a lovely interval of the day in this
latitude, and is even enjoyed by the hard-headed traders themselves.
Winter is a weary drag here—about seven months—lasting from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
October until well into May; but, in spite of its intense cold, there
are many long periods of its endurance characterized by clear,
lovely weather, while the warmer summer is rendered disagreeable
by a large number of cold misty days, rain, and gloomy palls of
overhanging clouds which shut down upon everything like a leaden
cover.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to associate an occurrence of a real mirage
with dry, arid, desert countries, where the thirsty and sun-burned
traveller is mocked by illusions of clear lakes and a green oasis just
ahead. In truth, the mirage of an Alaskan tundra in midwinter
is fully as remarkable, and quite as tantalizing. When the trader
starts out with his dog-team, on an intensely still, cold day, the vibrations
of the air are so energetic that those blades of grass which
stick out from the snow, just ahead, seem to him like thickets of willow- and
birch-trees, around which he must make a painful detour.
Then, again, the ravines and valleys are transformed into vast lakes,
with the loftiest and most precipitous shores. On the coast here,
during cool, clear days in March, hills, which are thirty or seventy-five
miles away from the windows of Michaelovsky, are lifted up
and transported to the very beach of the island itself, contorted and
fantastic changes constantly taking place in the picture, until suddenly
a slight something, or a change perhaps in an observer’s
position, causes the singular delusion to vanish.</p>

<p>St. Michael’s is all by itself to-day; yet it, at one time, was not
the only settlement on the island; for, close by the fort, there were
two Mahlemoöt villages, Tahcik and Agahliak, whose inhabitants
were first to cordially invite the Russians to locate here in 1835.
But in 1842 the ravages of small-pox absolutely depopulated these
native towns, and a few survivors fled in dismay from the place—they
never came back, nor have their descendants returned. For
some reason or other the Russians made the most persistent and
energetic attempt to develop a successful vegetable garden in this
region and to keep cattle. But, beyond a small exhibit of eatable
cabbages, good radishes and turnips, and a few inferior potatoes,
grown in the warm sand-dunes of Oonalakleet, nothing more, substantially,
ever resulted from it.</p>

<p>Generally the snow falls, at Michaelovsky, as the beginning of
its hyemal season, about October 1st, and by October 20th ice has
formed, and has firmly locked up the Yukon by November 1st to
5th. These icy fetters break away by June 5th, and in a week or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
ten days the great river is entirely clear. The sea is usually covered
by sludgy floes as early as the middle or end of every October,
which remain opening and closing irregularly until next June.
The months of July and August are the warmest, ranging from
48° to 54° Fahr. during daytime.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>From St. Michael’s to the westward a low basaltic chain of hills
borders the coast, and, parallel to it some thirty miles inland, a
few peaks attain an elevation of one thousand to fifteen hundred
feet. Jutting out at a sharp angle from this volcanic range stands
that low peninsula, tipped with the granitic headland named (by
Cook more than a century ago) Cape Denbigh. This point forms
the southern wall for that snug, tightly enclosed Bay of Norton,
thus partitioned off from a sound of the same title. The Oonalakleet
River empties into Norton’s Sound, at a point about midway
between Michaelovsky and Denbigh. The debouchure of this
stream is marked by the richest vegetation to be found anywhere
in all of this entire region north of Bristol Bay. It is due to the
warm sand-dune flats which are located here; and here is one of the
liveliest Mahlemoöt villages of that north. That river is an exclusive
gateway to the Yukon during the winter season, from and to
Michaelovsky, and these Innuits are the chief commission merchants
of Alaska. In a village, now called Kegohtowik, near by,
Zagoskin received his first initiation into the wild life which he led
up here as an explorer, since it was the first camp<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> he ever made
among the Innuits after he had started out from Michaelovsky.
This young Russian was kindly received by the wondering natives,
who unharnessed his dogs and hung up his sleds on the cache scaffolds
as a token of their hospitality. Into their kashga he was
taken with every demonstration of regard and curiosity. He happened
to have arrived just as these people were preparing for and
celebrating a great festival of homage to an Eskimo sea-god who
rules the icy waters of Bering and the Arctic Ocean. He quaintly
records their proceeding in this language:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span></p>

<p>“I had an opportunity of observing the natives preparing for
a great festival called by them ‘drowning little bladders in the
sea.’ In the front part of the kashga, on a strip of moose or other
skin, there were suspended about a hundred bladders taken from
animals killed by arrows only. On these bladders are painted various
fantastic figures. At one end of the trap hangs an owl with a
man’s head and a gull carved from wood; at the other end are two
partridges. By means of threads running to the crop-beam these
images are made to move in imitation of life. Below the bladders
is placed a stick six feet in height, bound about with straw. After
dancing in front of the bladders a native takes from the stick a small
wisp of straw, and lighting it, passes it under the bladders and birds
so that the smoke rises around them. He then takes the stick and
straw outside. This custom of ‘drowning little bladders in the sea’
is in honor of the sea-spirit called ‘Ug-iak;’ but I cannot discover,”
says Lieutenant Zagoskin, “how the custom originated, or why they
use bladders from animals killed by arrows in preference to those
killed by other means. To all questions upon the subject the natives
answered: ‘It is a custom which we took from our fathers and
our grandfathers.’ It seems to be of great antiquity, as the natives
can give no information as to its origin or the reasons for its adoption.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
Before these bladders they dance all day in their holiday
dress, which consists of light parka, warm boots, and short underdress
for the men; and parkas, reindeer-trousers, colored in Innuit
style, for women, and ornamented with glass beads and rings.”</p>

<p>And again, in this connection, the pleasures of a dog-sled journey
overland to the Yukon are graphically narrated by the same
traveller, who resumed his trip, after spending the night as above
related, on snow-shoes and dog-sleds laden with his provisions and
instruments. On the morning of December 9, 1842, he struck the
Oonalakleet River and started up its frozen channel. He says:</p>

<p>“The weather was at first favorable, but it soon changed, and a
driving snow-storm set in, blinding our eyes so that we could
not distinguish the path. A blade of grass seventy feet distant had
the appearance of a shrub, and sloping valleys looked like lakes
with high banks, the illusion vanishing upon nearer approach.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
On December 9th, at midnight, a terrible snow-storm began, and
in the short space of ten minutes covered men, dogs, and sledges,
forming a perfect hill above them. We sat at the foot of a hill,
with the wind from the opposite side, and our feet drawn under us
to prevent them from freezing, and covered with our parkas. When
we were covered by the snow, we made holes with sticks through to
the open air. In a short time the warmth of the breath and perspiration
melted the snow so that a man-like cave was formed about
each individual. In these circumstances our travellers passed five
hours, calling to one another at intervals to keep awake, it being
certain death to sleep in that intense cold. If we had been on the
other side of the hill, exposed to the full fury of the wind, we would
have been buried in the snow and suffocated.”</p>

<p>Such are the experiences of all travelling traders on the Yukon,
who encounter these wintry “poorgas” in the pursuit of their calling
every year of their lives spent in that great Alaskan moorland.
Familiarity with this subject never breeds contempt for it in the
minds of those hardy men—that pain and privation to which these
characteristic storms subject all human beings who are caught and
chained on a tundra, or in the mountains, by their wild rushing
and bitterly cold breath, is never forgotten.</p>

<p>On the shores of Norton’s Sound are many low clayey bluffs,
which, as they are annually undermined by the surf and chiselled by
frost, fall in heavy crumbled masses upon the beach. This exposes
their long-concealed deposit of the tusks and bones of those pre-glacial
elephants, the mammoth and the mastodon. Such fossil ivory
has been used by all Innuits from time immemorial in making
their sleds and in tipping their spears, lances, and arrows.</p>

<p>A party of Americans spent the summer of 1881 exploring the
country at the head of that deep indentation in the north shore of
Norton’s Sound called Golovin Bay. They were miners, and engaged
in locating the sources from which the Innuits had been
bringing large masses of lead-ore with a micaceous sparkle. The
hope of a silver-mine had allured these hardy prospectors, who had
not reckoned, however, on what they would have to face during the
long winter, on the ice that was always left in the soil. Still, in the
summer this bay of Golovin is an attractive anchorage—the most
agreeable landscape presented anywhere on our Arctic coast. Several
rivers empty into it, and on the slopes of the uplands of the
northwest side is a growth of white pines that reach a height of fifteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
or twenty feet. These small rounded conifers, scattered in
clumps over the green and russet tundra, an absence of underbrush,
and the dark-green lines of stunted willows and birches that
fill the ravines on the sloping sides of gently rising hills, suggest
the parking of an old-country place where the orchards are separated
by hedges.</p>

<p>The beaches everywhere are profusely littered with drift-logs
from the Yukon, twenty to forty feet in length, thickly strewn.
They are pushed high above tides by the ice-floes in winter. What
the result would be of failure to gain that abundant supply of fuel,
now so easy of attainment, upon the natives of this entire region, is
not difficult to determine. As they live to-day they are steadily,
rapidly diminishing in number. The whalemen have substantially
exterminated their chief sources of life—the whale and the walrus.
Seals are not as abundant as on the Greenland coasts, and if, in
addition to their extra labor of securing food-supply, they were
obliged to do without wood, a practical depopulation of the Alaskan
coast of Bering Straits and the Arctic Ocean would be effected
soon.</p>

<p>As the trader shapes his course from St. Michael’s for Port
Clarence and Kotzebue Sound, his little vessel skirts the low north
shore of Norton’s Sound very closely. He may stop for an hour or
two, if the weather permits, at Sledge Islet, standing “off and
on” while the Innuits come out to the schooner in their skin “oomiaks”
or bidarrahs. This barren rock was so named by Captain
Cook, who, when he landed on it, found nothing but a native’s
hand-sled. Its inhabitants were all sojourning on the mainland,
berrying. It is only about a mile in its greatest length, less than
half a mile wide, and raised almost perpendicularly from the sea to
a height of five or six hundred feet. When the modicum of walrus-oil
and ivory which these natives have to barter has been hoisted
on board, the schooner shapes her course for another islet—the
curious “Ookivok,” or King’s Island—which stands, a mere rock
as it were, in the flood that sweeps through Bering Straits. It is
rugged, and strewn with immense quantities of basaltic fragments,
scoriæ, and rises so precipitately from the sea that no place for a
beach-landing can be found.</p>

<p>Here on the south side, clinging like nests of barn-swallows, are
the summer houses of the Ookivok walrus-hunters. They are from
fifty to one hundred feet above the brawling surf that breaks incessantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
beneath them, and secured to the perpendicular cliffs by
lashings and guys of walrus-thongs. The wooden poles thus fastened
to the rocks are covered with walrus-hides. On these unique
brackets those hardy Innuits spend the warmer weather. Their
winter residences are mere holes excavated in the interstices and
fissures of the same bluff to which their flimsy summer dwellings
are attached, the entrances to most of them being directly under
the frail platforms upon which these Mahlemoöt families are
perched with all of their rude household belongings. The nakedness
of the island is so great as to forbid life to even a spear of
grass or moss—nothing but close, leathery lichens, that grow so
tightly to its weathered rocks that they appear to be part and parcel
of the splintered basaltic cubes or olivine bluffs themselves. A
more uninviting spot for human habitation could not be found in
all the savage solitudes of the north. But the Innuit is here, not
for the pleasure of location; he is here for that command which
this station gives him over all walrus-herds floating up and down
on the ice-floes of Bering Sea at the sport of varying moods of wind
and current.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p4260_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p4260_ill.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">Ookivok.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From the rugged crests of King’s Island the natives can apprehend
drifting sea-horses as they sleep heavily on broad ice-cakes,
and make ample preparation for their capture. The violence of the
wind is so great that the small, flat summit of this islet cannot be
utilized as a place of residence—the winds that howl over and
around its rock-strewn head would hurl the Innuits, bag and baggage,
into those angry waves which thunder incessantly below.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
Long experience at plunging through surf with their handsomely
made kayaks, and returning to land on these perilous shores of King’s
Island, has made the Ookivok people the boldest and the best watermen
in the north. Their little skin canoes are of the finest construction,
and their surplus time is largely passed in carving walrus-ivory
into all fashions of rude design for barter in the summer,
when the ice shall disappear and the sails of whaling-ships and fur-trading
schooners challenge their attention in the offing.</p>

<p>What a winter these people must witness! What a succession
of furious storms and snow-laden gales! When their summer
comes it brings but little sunlight to their rocky retreat; for,
standing, as it does, in the full sweep of that warmer flood which
flows up from the Japanese coast into the Arctic, cold, chilly fogs
and obstinate clouds envelope them most of the time. But sympathy
is utterly wasted; were they to be transported to California,
and surrounded with all the needs of a creature existence, they
would soon entreat, beg, implore us to return them to the inhospitable
rock from which they were taken. The whalers have, at various
intervals during the last twenty years, carried Innuits down to
spend the winter with them at the Sandwich Islands, under an
idea that these people would be delighted with the soft, warm climate
there, and such fruits and flowers, and be grateful for the trip.
But in no instance did an individual of this hyperborean race fail
to sigh for his home in Bering Sea, or the Arctic Ocean, soon after
landing at Hawaii. Those Innuits who were without kith or kin
became just as homesick and forlorn as any natives did who had
relatives behind awaiting their return.</p>

<p>A few hours’ sailing, with a free wind, to the north from King’s
Island, brings you into full view of a bold headland at the entrance
to Port Clarence. Cape York is a noted landmark in this
well-travelled highway to the Arctic Ocean—well travelled by the
whaling fleets of the whole world until recently; now, an elimination
of cetacean life from these waters has caused their substantial
abandonment by those vessels, and no others come, save a trading-schooner
ever and anon at wide intervals. A roomy harbor, sheltered
from the south by a long pier of alluvium, is Port Clarence.
Leading beyond it is an immense inner basin, walled in all about
by steep slate precipices: this is Grantley Harbor. High hopes and
great expectations were centred here in 1865-66, by the location of
that short cable-end which, underrunning Bering Straits, was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
unite an overland telegraph wire from St. Petersburg with that one
we were to build, in the same fashion, from Portland, Ore., thus
to span the Old and New Worlds by this short submarine link.
Naturally, then, it made this point of its beginning a most interesting
locality. In obedience to an order of a few wealthy, energetic
capitalists, who did not then believe in the practicability of the Atlantic
cable, many stately ships, freighted with men and goods, left
San Francisco in the summer of 1865, and, again, in the succeeding
season of 1866, for divers points in Alaska and Siberia. These men
were to build the line overland. They were landed at St. Michael’s
and at Port Clarence, and at several harbors on the Asiatic coast.
They had fairly got to work, when, late in 1866, the success of the
submarine cable between Newfoundland and Ireland was assured.
That success compelled an abandonment of the Collins Overland
Telegraph, and these men were consequently recalled, and sailed
back to California in those handsome vessels of the telegraph fleet.
How the Innuits of Port Clarence marvelled when these smart,
richly dressed men disembarked, and put up houses in which to
store their treasures of food and telegraph materials, as well as to
actually live in—to stay there with them, in their own rude country,
where no such thing had ever been even dreamed of before. After
the ships had squared their yards and filled away, without calling
the Americans on board, then the Mahlemoöt heart was filled with
unknown and strange emotions of joy and curiosity—both of these
passions were fully satisfied ere the white men left Grantley Harbor.</p>

<p>With Cape York just astern, you pass under the lee of those
sheer and lofty walls of that shoulder to our continent, Cape Prince
of Wales. Its bold front stands in full but silent recognition of an
Asiatic coast westward, just thirty-six miles away, over the shallow
flood of Bering Straits. What changes in a great northland and
seas would have been wrought had a tithe of such volcanic energy
which raised up the Aleutian archipelago been only exerted here in
throwing a basaltic dike across from continent to continent! Had
the upheaval and power that elevated the large island of Oonimak
alone been focused here, we should have no division of the Old
World and the New. That ocean-river which flows steadily into
the icy wastes of a known and unknown polar basin above Alaska
and Siberia would not now give that life which it so freely grants
both animals and vegetables in the wide reach of the North Pacific.
A dam of adamantine rock or basalt across the Straits of Bering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>would cause a startling revision of all the natural order of life in
Bering Sea and our Arctic Ocean.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">CAPE PRINCE OF WALES</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">That extreme narrowing of the American shore of Bering Straits: the Asiatic coast is only thirty-six miles to the Westward from this Point,
which was located and named by Captain Cook, August 7, 1778</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Cape Prince of Wales, which forms the extreme narrowing of
Bering Straits, is a high, rugged promontory, with walls on the
south side that are abrupt precipices of a full thousand feet, while
the uplands rise, culminating in a snowy crown that is twenty-five
hundred feet above the level of the sea. Deep gulches seam these
vertical walls, and are the paths of numerous tiny rivulets that
trickle and run in cascades down from the spongy moorlands above.
When, however, you stand in to the straits, homeward bound from
the Arctic Ocean, this cape on that side presents a wholly different
outline. It slopes up gradually from the beaches, and presents the
appearance of a tundra gently rising to a small ridge-like summit.
This lowland on the north side is projected under the sea for a distance
of over eight miles in a northerly direction, making an exceedingly
dangerous shoal, and justly dreaded by the mariner.</p>

<p>The Siberian side and opposite headland is the bold and lofty
East Cape, and is connected with the mainland by a low neck of
rolling tundra, which is characteristic of Cape Prince of Wales
also. Both of these outposts of two mighty continents present, at
a small distance, the resemblance of islands.</p>

<p>On June 20th, two hundred and thirty-eight years ago (1648),
Simeon Deschnev, a Cossack chief trader, sailed from the mouth of
the Siberian river Kolyma, standing to the eastward, where he intended
to cruise until the country of those Chookchie natives, who
had ivory for trade, should be reached. His party sailed in three
small “kotches,” which were rude wooden shallops, decked over,
about thirty feet long and twelve in beam, drawing but little water.
They pushed on and on in that region to the eastward, from
which direction the nomadic natives of the Kolyma had always returned
laden with walrus-ivory. Fields of ice retarded them; no
populous trading-villages rewarded their scrutiny of the rugged
coast as they advanced. The known waters behind them closed up
with floes, so returning was impossible; while the unknown waters
ahead were open and invited exploration. In this manner, hugging
the coast, Deschnev and his companions sailed through the
straits, landing once there in September. He called it an “isthmus,”
and described the appearance of the Diomede Islands, which he
plainly saw from the shore. Although no mention is made by any
one of this party of having seen the American continent, yet it must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
have been observed by them, for the bold headland of Cape Prince
of Wales can be easily descried on any clear day from the Asiatic
side. Deschnev’s voyage had been quite forgotten until Müller, in
hunting over old records in 1764, found the narrative then, and at
once published it in the “Morskoi Sbornik.”</p>

<p>A long interregnum elapsed between the hardy voyage of Simeon
Deschnev and the next or second passage of the straits by the
keel of a white man’s vessel. Not until August, 1728, did Bering
sail through here. He went only a short distance above, into the
Arctic Ocean, and returned without giving any sign thereafter of
the importance of the pass or its nature, believing, most likely,
that what land he saw on the eastern side was a mere island and
not a great American continent. But that intrepid navigator, Captain
Cook, who comes third in this early initiation of our race,
made no mistake: he fully realized that the division of two hemispheres
was here effected, and so declared the fact, and then gave
to these straits, in a most chivalric manner, the name of Bering,
August, 1778.</p>

</figure>

<p>Midway, stepping-stones as it were, across those straits are the
Diomedes, two barren, rocky islets and a sheer rock. The largest and
the most western is about three miles long and one in width; it is
seven or eight hundred feet in abrupt elevation from the water, and
the line of division between the Siberian possessions and our own
just takes it in. The sister island is somewhat smaller, less than
half as large, but it is as bold and sheer in its rocky elevation,
leaving a channel-width of two miles only in between. The first
is named Ratmanov, or <em>Noornabook</em>; the second, Kroozenstern, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
<em>Ignalook</em>; while that high isolated hay-cock mass, about seven miles
south of Kroozenstern, is called Fairway Rock. Bering Straits has
an average depth of only twenty-six fathoms, with a hard, regular
bottom of sand, gravel, and silt.</p>

<p>This gateway to the Arctic Ocean is closed by ice-floes usually
by the middle or end of October every year, and opened again in
the following season by May 25th or June 1st, but the ice-fields
do not allow much room for navigation north until the middle or
end of June, sometimes not until the month of July has been well
passed.</p>

<p>On that low, northern tundra slope of Cape Prince of Wales is
the largest Innuit village in the Alaskan northland. Four hundred
souls live there in a settlement which they style Kingigahmoot, and
they bear unmistakable evidence of the vicious and degrading influence
which evil whalers and rum-traders have exerted. We are
struck by their saucy flippancy, their restless, meddlesome, and impertinent
bearing. It is because these people have been for a great
many years thoroughly familiarized with and degraded by all the
tricks and petty treacheries of dishonest and disreputable white
men. They do not draw a line in favor of any decency in our race
to-day, and hence their disagreeable manner. Otherwise, beyond
shaving the crowns of their heads, they do not differ from the
Innuits whom we have met heretofore. They are seamen in the
full sense of the word—hardy, reckless navigators who boldly
launch themselves into stormy waters and cross from land to land
in tempest and in fogs, depending solely upon the frail support of
their walrus-skin baidars, or oomiaks. These are very neatly made,
however, the covering of seal- and walrus-hides being stretched and
sewed tightly over wooden frames that are lashed at the joints with
sinew and whalebone-thongs. They hoist a square sail of deer-skins
or cotton drilling, and run before the wind in heavy gales; or
they employ paddles and oars, and urge their craft against head-winds
and perverse currents. Their poverty is the only redemption
which they have had from absolute destruction; for were they possessed
of furs that would encourage the regular visits of traders,
they would, with their disposition to debauchery, have been utterly
exterminated long before this time. But they are poor, very poor,
having nothing to tempt the cupidity of white traders—nothing but
small stores of walrus-oil and teeth, and a few red and white foxes,
perhaps. Therefore our people never stop long near them, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
laying the vessel’s sails aback for a few minutes, or an hour, while
the dusky paddling crews of the oomiaks surrounding the schooner
exhibit their slim stocks of oil and ivory.</p>

<p>These northern Innuits are not known anywhere to have a village
located far back from the sea save at three places, where, on the
Selawik, the Killiamoot, and the Kooak Rivers, are settlements of
a few people who are at least fifty and one or two hundred miles
inland; but they are the exceptions only to their rule of living.
Some thirty-five villages of these hyperborean Innuits of Alaska
are scattered along the coast between St. Michael’s and Point Barrow;
they possess an aggregate (estimated) inhabitation of three
thousand men, women, and children. The Diomede and Prince of
Wales natives are the most active middlemen or commission merchants
among their people; they conduct all the trade between
the Asiatic Chookchie savages and the American Innuits, chiefly
with those of Kotzebue Sound. Before a wholesale destruction
by our people, in 1849-57, of the whales that once were so abundant
in these waters, the life of those natives was a comparatively
easy struggle for existence, and they were far more numerous then
than they are to-day; but a fleet of four and five hundred whaling-ships,
manned by the hardiest men of all nations, literally swept that
cetacean life from the North Pacific and Bering Sea, and drove it so
far into the Arctic Ocean that its remnant, which is still there, is
practically safe and beyond human reach.</p>

<p>As you leave the Straits of Bering behind, your little vessel cuts
the cold, green waves of the Arctic Ocean rapidly, especially if under
the pressure of a warm southwester which funnels up stiffly through
the pass. You find nothing to catch your eye in all that long reach
from Cape Prince of Wales to the entrance of Kotzebue Sound,
which is an objective point of all the traders who come into the
Arctic. Here is the last safe Alaskan harbor for a sea-going vessel
as we go north. It is a big one; and it is a famous place for a
geologist and Innuits alike. To the latter it is of especial significance,
since the small rivers which empty there mark an extreme
northern limit of salmon-running in America.</p>

<p>The shores which bound this large gulf rise as perpendicular
bluffs, either directly from the water or from a shelving beach. In
some places the land is remarkably low (as it always is when bordering
the coast), and only so much raised above tide-level as to
render the idea probable that it is of an alluvial formation, the result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
of accumulated mud and sand, brought down in former times
by the melting and running of large glacial rivers, and then thrown
up later by recent ice-floes of the Arctic Sea. The cliffs are, in part,
abrupt and rocky; others are made up of falling masses of mud,
sand, and ice. The rocky cliffs are dominant on the western and
southern shores, while the diluvial bluffs and flats complete that
remaining east and northeast circuit of the sound. Lowlands border
a major portion of the Bay of Good Hope, and form the land
of Cape Espenberg and contiguous country.</p>

<p>A most striking natural feature of this final rendezvous of the
salmon-loving Innuits is the Peninsula of Choris, which divides the
inner waters of the Bay of Escholtz from those of Good Hope. It
is a narrow, variously indented tongue; its northern end is separated
from the southern, and connected by a slender neck of very
low land. This lower point assumes the shape of a round and somewhat
conical eminence, surmounted by a flat, hut-like peak, the sides
of which rise a few feet perpendicularly above a surrounding surface,
as though raised artificially by masonry. The whole height is
about six hundred feet above sea-level. Both sides of that quaint
headland terminate in rocky cliffs which, toward the west, are one
hundred and fifty or two hundred feet high, stratified, unbroken,
and dipping to the west at an angle of thirty degrees. They are
composed of micaceous slate, with no included minerals. This slate
is of a greenish hue, with a very considerable predominance of mica.
In it are garnets, veins of feldspar enclosing crystals of schorl, and
fissures filled with quartz. At one point, nearly midway between
the southern end of this peninsula and its low neck, is a singular
bed of pure milk-white quartz, that marks its locality from a long
distance by the masses of large white blocks which have fallen down
by natural processes of cleavage and frost-chiselling, and these remain
unaltered in their snowy color in spite of the corroding action
of time and weather. Again, still nearer the neck, a narrow bed of
limestone forms a distinct protrusion above some mica-schist, about
thirty feet in length and five in depth. It reappears in such
strength, however, at the southern end of the peninsula, that it
forms most of the rock exposed, and produces four perpendicular
and contiguous promontories, separated from each other by small,
receding bays, that present curious walls striped a white and blue
tint in beautifully blended stratification, most unique and attractive
to the eye. The upper part of this limestone contains iron pyrites,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
and has cavities filled with chlorite. The lower strata are more
abundantly mixed with micaceous schistus, containing compact
actynolite, and flat prisms of a glassy shade of it, crystals of tourmaline,
and those various concretions of iron pyrites. The quartz
is, in some places, colored a real topaz tint. Such, in brief, is a faint
description of those geological attractions which the Arctic rocks of
Kotzebue Sound present to a student.</p>

<p>The country everywhere, that borders the Arctic Ocean and this
sound, is low. The land rises by faint and gradual slopes; it is
covered with clay soils and the characteristic vegetation of a tundra.
The many low, projecting points of Kotzebue Sound are
thickly strewn with large and smaller masses of vesicular and of
compact lava, containing olivine. Some of these blocks extend into
the sea; others are embedded in the sandy soil of the beach; but
many are insulated and awash above the surf. They are honeycombed
with empty cavities. The sands of this Arctic Ocean beach
partake of the black and volcanic nature of those blocks. These
large and numerous erratic blocks of basalt, collected chiefly on
such jutting points, must have been conveyed there by ice-sheets
from a very considerable distance, for no volcanic formation is to be
seen in their vicinity.</p>

<p>A suggestive wreck lies half buried in the sand and drift of the
north shore of Choris Peninsula—it is the scant and weathered
remnants of a large whaling-bark, which was run ashore here and
burned. Its own crew did so to prevent its capture by the <em>Shenandoah</em>—that
cruiser which, during our civil war, swooped down upon
our Asio-Alaskan whaling-fleet, as a fish-hawk drops upon a flock
of startled gulls. Again, on the south side of Good Hope Bay, in
this same remarkable sound of Kotzebue, is a bluff of solid blue
clay, from the face of which the frost-king annually strikes large
masses. The weathered débris of these fallen sections reveal many
fine specimens of well-preserved remains of huge pachyderms—mammoths—and
their finding has given a fit name of “Elephant
Point” to the place.</p>

<p>Across that peninsula, which Choris Point and its comical little
tender of Chamisso Islet project from, lies the long and narrow estuary
of Hotham Inlet, where all Innuits, from Icy Cape to the far
north and Bering Straits in the south, annually repair for salmon-fishing
in August. Into the mouths of a half-dozen small streams
which empty there, and that large one, of Kooak River, the humpbacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>
salmon runs, for a brief period, in great numbers: then the
harvest of the Eskimo is at hand. Nowhere else above this point
can a salmon ever be taken, and as it is the last chance of these
natives, they improve it. Flocks of fat ducks and geese hover over
and rest upon the smooth, shallow waters of this inlet, alternately
feeding there and then alighting upon the tundra where crowberries
and insects abound. Our whalers have taught these Innuits
how to make and use gill-nets, with which they now catch their fish
almost exclusively; and not unwisely have those natives made the
change, for they have not got any slender willow brush and alder-saplings
which their brethren use so effectually in making rude
traps on the Yukon, Kuskokvim, and Nooshagak Rivers. They also
stretch these gill-nets over certain narrow places, from shore to
shore, of lagoons and lakes, where flocks of water-fowl are wont to
fly (in early morning and late in the evening), and succeed in capturing
a great many luckless birds by this simple method.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_157" href="#FNanchor_157" class="label">[157]</a> The first white man to enter the Yukon and behold its immense volume
was Glazoonov, a Russian post-trader of the old Company, who, with a small
band of promishlyniks, managed to overcome the hostility of the natives sufficiently
to get up as far as the present site of Nulato. This was in 1833.
Lieutenant Zagoskin, of the Russian Navy, made a thorough engineering examination
of the river up as far as the “Ramparts,” between the years 1842-45,
inclusive, locating its positions and courses by astronomical and magnetic
observations. After him, named in regular order of their priority in visiting
the river, came the following Americans, the first in 1865, the last in 1885:—Kennicott,
Pease, Adams, Ketchum, Dall, Whymper, Mercier, Raymond, Hill
and Shaw (two miners, from its very source), Nelson, Petroff, then Schwatka
and Everett (also from its source). All of these men have given to the world
more or less elaborate accounts of the Yukon through the medium of published
works, letters, and lectures. The literature on the single subject of the
Kvichpak is decidedly voluminous.</p>

<p class="no-indent">An Innuit village is in plain sight on the low shores of Cape Kroozenstern,
which forms a northern pier-head of Kotzebue Sound, and
its inhabitants greet your vessel as it passes out and up the coast with
the usual dress-parade—climbing upon the summits of their winter
houses, and by running in light-hearted mirth along the beach.
A most dreary expanse of low moorland borders the coast as the little
schooner reviews it, swiftly heeling on her course to the north.
Not until the bluffs of Cape Thompson are in sight does a noteworthy
landmark occur. This is an abrupt headland capped by
carboniferous limestone full of fossils, shells, corals and the like,
which are peculiar to that age. It is also traversed by veins of a
blackish chert varying in thickness from six inches to three feet or
more, causing a decided network tracery to appear very plainly on
its gray-white face. Half-way down from the top, the limestone is
succeeded by blue, black, and gray argillaceous shades, the colors
of which alternate in layers of horizontal strata, six or eight feet in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
thickness, nearly down to the base; it is then composed of black
carboniferous shales alone, which abound in organic remains and
are occasionally interstratified by limestone much deflected. This
contortion is so great as to form two regularly banded arches. Several
tiny snow-water cascades tumble down its ravines and boldly
plunge over the bluffs, which are about four hundred feet high in
their greatest elevation.</p>

<p>This chert is that which the Eskimo of the entire Alaskan arctic
region (before the coming of white men) used for tipping their
lance- and arrow-heads when ivory was not employed. They, aided
with a small piece of bone, were able to “flake” it off in slices that
were easily reduced to the desired forms. They still work a little
of it up every year, in a desultory or perfunctory manner, however,
more for amusement than anything else, since they have a profusion
of iron and steel now in their possession. The fashion in which they
chip it gives ample evidence of their full understanding of a flat conchoidal
fracture peculiar to flint, and of which they take advantage.</p>

<p>To the northwest of Cape Thompson the coast runs out abruptly
as a low spit, projected into the Arctic Ocean for a distance of
twenty miles. This is Port Hope. The beach everywhere is principally
formed of dark basaltic gravel. To the north of a considerable
stream not far from this point, and on a low and diluvial shore, is a
large hamlet of Innuits, who have covered the turfy thatches on
their winter houses with heavy blocks of angular clink-stones picked
up from the sea-beach. The whole surface of the interior country
here is raised several hundred feet above tide-level, and is diversified
with saddle-backed hills of gray and bronzed tints, separated by
wide valleys in which a rich green summer verdancy is characteristic.
Here and there conical eminences and perpendicular shelving
cliffs arise from a general evenness of the whole landscape.
These cliffs seem to be composed of limestones, while their acclivities
are of slate and shale.</p>

<p>As we near Cape Lisburne a jutting range of bluffs, stratified in
bands of grayish-brown and black, receive the full wash of the sea,
and are called Cape Dyer; but Cape Lisburne is the striking landmark,
and a most important one for the navigator to recognize. It
is composed of two remarkable promontories: the southwestern
one rises abruptly from the surf, is covered with loose gray stones,
divested of the smallest traces of vegetation. The northeastern one
rises gradually, and, although but thinly clad with verdure, it forms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
a pleasing and marked contrast with the gray head of the other.
The first is elevated from the sea in distinct strata, with a southwestern
dip, and consists of layers of impure chert in its central and
most prominent projections, and of a soft, friable slate and shale in
its worn and more retiring sides. The front of the second is rugged
and shelving, with very indistinct bandings; it is partly covered
with tundra vegetable-growths, and with fallen masses of gray flint.
Both points to this double-headed cape of Lisburne are easily accessible;
they are about one thousand feet in height from the shore
of the ocean, and both stretch their ridges away inland far to the
southeast.</p>

<p>The highly elevated country here ceases at once to the northeast
of Cape Lisburne, where the entire coast-line, away on and off to
Icy Cape, and beyond again, forms a deep and extensive bay skirted
by a dark, low beach. A gravel-flat fronts this again, filled with
shallow estuaries and lagoons. The land of the interior rises from
that beach in a series of low, earthy cliffs and in gradual acclivities.</p>

<p>The coal-veins, which Beechey visited in 1826, are about fifty
miles to the eastward of Lisburne, embedded in a ridge some three
hundred feet high where it juts into the ocean. This point is
known as Cape Beaufort. A narrow vein of pure carboniferous coal
is exposed there, about a quarter of a mile from the beach. “It
was slaty, but burned with a bright, clear flame and rapid consumption.”
Again, at a point about midway between Beaufort and Lisburne,
directly at the surf-margin, the officers of the United States
Revenue Marine cutter <em>Corwin</em> mined a few tons of this same coal
in 1880-81. But no harbor for a coaling ship is near by; the
steady north and westerly winds of summer, which blow right on
shore almost all of that short time in which a vessel can navigate
the Arctic, make it very doubtful whether these remote mines of
Alaskan “black diamonds” will ever be of real economic value.</p>

<p>That sand- and shingle-spit ahead of us, which the whalers have
named Icy Cape with perfect fitness, is in itself almost invisible,
since it is a mere continuation of the outer rim to a remarkable
lagoon which borders this coast from Cape Beaufort to Wainright
Inlet, over one hundred miles in length, and varying in width from
five to ten miles, with an average depth of two fathoms. It is
spanned by occasional sand-bars, some of them entirely dry, so that
it is not navigable except for those small boats and oomiaks of
the natives, who haul these craft across as they journey, thus safe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
and snug, up and down a desolate coast. This lagoon of the Arctic
Ocean has several openings to the sea itself. Small schooners
can run in and escape from ice-pack “jams,” if they draw less
than eight or ten feet of water. The coast-line of the mainland at
Icy Cape is a series of low mud-cliffs, varying from ten to fifty feet
in height above a shingly beach, which is everywhere composed
of fine, minutely comminuted, pebbly bases of granite, of chert, of
sienite, and of indurated clay, the last being a predominant form.</p>

<p>From this point clear around to the boundary of our Alaskan
Arctic coast at Point Demarcation that country presents the same
appearance which we note here. It is low and slightly rolling, and
falls in small cliffs of mud or sandstone at the sea-shore. During
the midsummer season it wears a hue of gray and brown, with little
patches of bright green where the snow has melted early in
sunny, sheltered spots. The lines of many streams, as they course
in carrying off melting snows, are plainly marked over a dreary
tundra by the dark fringes of dwarfed willows, birches, and alders
which only grow upon their banks.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">Innuit Whaling-camp at Icy Cape.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>All along this cheerless northern sea-shore are small and widely
scattered settlements of our Innuits, who burrow in their turfy underground
winter huts, and who tent outside in summer-time upon
these shingly gravels and clink-stones of the Arctic coast. They
then live upon the walrus and kill an occasional calf-whale. For
the better apprehension of these animals they erect lookouts on the
beach by setting up drift-wood scaffolds, and climbing as lookouts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
to an elevated platform thus made. In the winter, when the weather
permits, they net a ringed seal (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phoca fœtida</i>) under the ice, make
short inland trips, where they camp for weeks at a time in rude
snow-houses, hunting reindeer, which are shy though abundant,
and they trap a few wolves and foxes. Every July and August
they expect the visit of a few whaling-vessels at least, and they are
seldom disappointed, for such craft are compelled by ice-floes to
hug this shore very closely, in order to get as far to the eastward
as the whales are found; sometimes, in spite of all the wariness and
skill of our own hardy whalemen, great floe-booms, of icy make,
suddenly shut down on that land so quickly from the north as to
catch and crush the staunchest ships like egg-shells under foot.
Then, indeed, is the sadness and the distress of the white men
sharply contrasted with that great joy and happy anticipation of an
Innuit who feasts his eyes and gloats in fancy over the abandoned
vessels as they lie riven by ice upon those shallow strands of Icy
Cape or Point Barrow.</p>

<p>It is more than sixty years now since Captain Beechey<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> camped
upon and located Point Barrow, our extreme limit of northern
landed possession, and in that time few changes, other than depopulation
of the natives, have taken place on this coast. That same
village of Noowuk, which he graphically described, still stands there
on the tip of a low gravel-spit which extends out from the mainland
twelve miles into the chill flood of an Arctic Ocean. All the land
at its extremity not inundated by the sea in storms is now, as it
was then, occupied by the winter houses of the natives. Blooming
here in the short summer of July, on those desolate moors adjacent
to Point Barrow, is the same dandelion and buttercup which filled
the Englishman then, as it does us now, with thoughts of meadows
at home, and some bright little poppies still nod their yellow heads
again to us, as they did to him, on this low north end of Alaska.
A tiny golden butterfly flits from flower to flower, and as they fade,
it, too, disappears over frost-bitten swales.</p>

<p>Big ice-fields seldom ever fail to threaten the coast here, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
when they relax their grasp in July. In a few short weeks, however,
they return to stay for the rest of the year and best part of
the next. Such brief intervals for navigation in the Arctic Ocean
during every July and August are those which lure whaling-ships,
and the dark lanes of open water in white ice-floes are the last
refuge of many hard-hunted whales, unless they dive, and rise to
breathe again in that conjectured clear yet frigid flood of a polar
sea, far away under the north star.</p>

<p>There is nothing more to see, or noteworthy to learn, at or beyond
Point Barrow, even were you to live and drag out a wretched
year’s existence in looking for it, so you gladden the heart of your
skipper and his hardy crew by telling them to shape a course homeward.
Back through the Straits of Bering, wrapped in a chill
thick fog, the little schooner heels, with a singing northwester on
her quarter that holds her canvas just as taut as if made of tough
wood. She fairly scrapes by the Diomedes—the walls of Noornabook
loom up high in a cold, gray fog-light, as though its bold,
gray cliffs were right over her spars—but the crew know at the time
that they are more than two miles away from that surf which noisily
thunders on the dark rocks of these islets. That same chill wind,
and gloomy fog-surrounding, follows them into Bering Sea—not a
glimpse of all the land and mountain, which they so plainly discerned
going up, have they caught going down.</p>

<p>What trifles often determine our success or failure in life! Had
it not been for a sudden sunburst from the gloom of a leaden fog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
which shrouded all about it in its misty darkness, and thus lighted
up a lofty russet head of the East Cape of St. Lawrence Island, a
little vessel bearing the author would have been piled up and
thrown into foaming breakers which beat upon a low, rocky reef
that reaches out from its feet. This gleam of light reflected from
that headland warned a startled man on the lookout just in time to
have her wheel put hard up, and thus luff our light trim craft in
season to shave safely by.</p>

<p>St. Lawrence is the largest island in Bering Sea. It is directly
south of Bering Straits, one hundred and eighty miles distant
from the Diomedes; it is eighty to eighty-five miles in length, with
an average width of fifteen or twenty. The sea has built onto it
quite extensively, in very much the same manner as it has filled
out and extended the coast of St. Paul, of the Pribylov group. At
Kagallegak, on the east shore, the island is made up of coarse feldspathic,
red granitic flats and hills, with extensive lagoons and
lakelets. The skeleton of this island seems to have been originally
one of low hills and ranges of granite, with volcanic outbursts everywhere
manifested at their summits, especially on the north shore.
Between them stretch long, low plains, or gently rolling uplands,
and perfectly smooth reaches of sand and gravelly beaches that
border the sea everywhere not so marked by bluffs.</p>

<p>At Kagallegak your eye sweeps over extensive level plains to the
northward, upon which a green-stalked and white-plumed tundra
grass (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eriophorum</i>) principally grows everywhere on the wet and
boggy surface, while, on those sand-beach margins, the “wild wheat”
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elymus</i>) springs up most abundantly, short and stunted, however.
These extended low areas of moorland so peculiar to this island
are made up of fine granitic drift and clays, lined at their sea-borders
with a low, broad sand-belt. The hills and hill ranges of St.
Lawrence are rich in color, with dark blue-black patches interspersed
which indicate a location of trap-protrusions. No shrubbery
whatever grows upon these wind-swept tundra and hills save
dwarfed and creeping willows; yet, a series of characteristic rock-lichens
color such bare summits in their bright relief which we
have just noted. The rocks themselves are reddish, coarse-grained,
shining granites, with abundant trap-protrusions, that weather out
and fall down upon the flanks of the peaks and ridges in dusky
patches and streaks, so as to contrast, from a slight distance, very
sharply with the main ground of pinkish rock, which is moss- and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span>lichen-grown, and colored here and there with areas of that peculiar
and characteristic greenish-russet tinge of sphagnous origin.
This dark marking of those trap-dikes appears like the presence of
low-growing shrubbery from the vessel, as an observer sails by.
Snow and ice lie all the year around in small bodies within the
gullies and on the hill-sides.</p>

</figure>

<p>The lower plains have a richer, warmer, yellowish-green tone
than that cold tint of the uplands, while the sand of the sea-shore is
a bright light-brown. Small streams flow down from these hills,
and twist and turn sluggishly through the tundra as they lead to
lakes or empty directly into the sea—a few parr, or young salmon,
being the only fish in them that can be found; most of the fresh-water
lakes and lagoons are, however, fairly stocked with familiar-looking
mullets (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catastomus</i>), but nothing else.</p>

<p>The entire expanse of these lowlands of St. Lawrence are precisely
like all of those vast reaches of Alaskan tundra—they are
great saturated, earthy sponges, filled and overrunning with water
in midsummer—the chief and happiest vegetation upon them
being that same beautiful tufted or plumed grass which we noticed
at Michaelovsky, since the white and silken tassels of its
feathery inflorescence never fail to charm even tired and travel-worn
eyes. This grass, in conjunction with several rank-growing
mosses, the trailing runners of the crowberry-vines, and little
patches of the humble arctic raspberry (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rubus chamæmorus</i>) make
up that conventional tundra color of russet-green (flecked with
grayish-blue spots on the slopes of stern northern exposures) which
mark these great marshy tracts of Alaska, and under which eternal
frost is found, even in midsummer, a foot or two only from
their surfaces. Small white shells of a land-mollusk (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">succinea</i>) are
scattered thickly over these moorlands.</p>

<p>On the flats of the east shore of St. Lawrence a great abundance
of drift-wood was piled in much confusion. Here the natives had a
wood-cutting camp, hewing and carving; its chips were scattered
all along the beach-levels for miles. There are places, here, where
the ice in some unusual seasons has carried large logs and pieces
of drift-wood far back, full half a mile from the sea, and a vigorous
growth of tundra vegetation now flourishes in between; and there
they lie to-day deeply embedded in the swale, settling down in decay—that
slow, hungering eremacausis of the Arctic.</p>

<p>The Innuits, living here as they do, some three or four hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
in number, are great walrus-hunters. They enjoy a location that
enables them to secure these animals at all seasons of a year. In winter
the sea-horse floats on big ice-fields; but during summer-time
the “aibwook” hauls up to sun and rest his heavy body in and on
the inviting peace of those beaches of St. Lawrence. A famous spot
for this landing of the walrus is on the rocky and pebbly shores of
Poonook (three small rocky islets), just five miles east of the summer
tents of Kagallegak. These tiny, detached fragments of St.
Lawrence stand in the full sweep of those air- and water-currents
which keep broad ice-floes
in constant motion, and
thus bring walrus-herds
into range of Mahlemoöt
hunters, who have a winter
village dug deep into sandy
flats of “Poonookah.”</p>

<p>Naturally enough we
regard the walrus with
more than passing interest,
for it plays so large and so
vital a part in sustaining
the life of human beings
who reside in these arctic
and subarctic regions of
Alaska. Perhaps the only
place in all this extended
area in which these clumsy
brutes are found, where
the creature itself can be
closely observed and studied, is that unique islet, six miles east of
St. Paul (Pribylov group) and about four hundred miles south of
St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>Here the morse rests upon some rocky, surf-washed tables characteristic
of this place without being disturbed; hence the locality
afforded me a particularly pleasant and advantageous opportunity
of minutely observing these animals. My observations, perhaps,
would not have passed over a few moments of general notice, had I
found a picture presented by them such as I had drawn in my
mind from previous descriptions; the contrary, however, stamping
itself so suddenly and decidedly upon my eye, set me to work with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
pen and brush in noting and portraying such extraordinary brutes,
as they lay grunting and bellowing, unconscious of my presence,
and not ten feet away from the ledge upon which I sat.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Sitting as I did to the leeward of them, with a strong wind blowing
in at the time from seaward, which, ever and anon, fairly covered
many of them with foaming surf-spray, therefore they took no notice
of me during the three or more hours of my study. I was first astonished
at observing the raw, naked appearance of the hide: it was
a skin covered with multitudes of pustular-looking warts and large
boils or pimples, without hair or fur, save scattered and almost invisible
hairs; it was wrinkled in deep, flabby seam-folds, and marked by
dark-red venous lines, which showed out in strong contrast through
the thicker and thinner yellowish-brown cuticle, that in turn seemed
to be scaling off in places as if with leprosy; indeed, a fair expression
of this walrus-hide complexion if I may use the term, can be
understood by the inspection of those human countenances in the
streets and on the highways of our cities which are designated as
the faces of “bloats.” The forms of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosmarus</i> struck my eye at
first in a most unpleasant manner, and the longer I looked at them
the more heightened was my disgust; for they resembled distorted,
mortified, shapeless masses of flesh; those clusters of big, swollen,
watery pimples, which were of a yellow, parboiled flesh-color, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
principally located over the shoulders and around the necks, painfully
suggested unwholesomeness.</p>

<p>On examining the herd individually, and looking upon perhaps
one hundred and fifty specimens directly beneath and within the
sweep of my observation, I noticed that there were no females
among them; they were all males, and some of the younger ones
had considerable hair, or enough of that close, short, brown coat to
give a hirsute tone to their bodies—hence I believe that it was only
the old, wholly matured males which offered to my eyes such bare
and loathsome nakedness.</p>

<p>I noticed, as they swam around, and before they landed, that
they were clumsy in the water, not being able to swim at all like
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phocidæ</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Otariidæ</i>; yet their progress in the sea was
wonderfully alert when brought into comparison with that terrestrial
action of theirs; the immense bulk and weight of this walrus,
contrasted with the size and strength of its limbs, renders it simply
impotent when hauled out of the water on those low, rocky
beaches or shelves upon which it rests. Like the seals, however, it
swims entirely under water when travelling, but it does not rise, in
my opinion, so frequently to take breath; when it does, it blows or
snorts not unlike a whale. Often have I heard this puffing snort
of those animals (since the date of these observations on Walrus
Islet), when standing on the bluffs near the village of St. Paul and
looking seaward; on one cool, quiet morning in May I followed
with my eye and ear a herd of walrus, tracing its progress some
distance off and up along the east coast of the island by those tiny
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>jets of moisture or vapor from its confined breath which the animals
blew off as they rose to respire.</p>

</figure>

<p>Mariners, while coasting in the Arctic, have often been put on
timely footing by a walrus fog-horn snorting and blowing as the
ship dangerously sails silently through dense fog toward land or
ice-floes, upon which those animals may be resting; indeed, these
uncouth monitors to this indistinct danger rise and bob under and
around a vessel like so many gnomes or demons of fairy romance,
and sailors may well be pardoned for much of that strange yarning
which they have given to the reading world respecting the sea-horse
during the last three centuries.</p>

<p>When a walrus-herd comes ashore, after short preliminary surveys
of the intended spot of landing, an old veteran usually takes
the lead of a band which is so disposed.</p>

<p>Finally the first one makes a landing, and no sooner gets composed
upon the rocks for sleep than a second one comes along,
prodding and poking with its blunted tusks, demanding room also,
thus causing the first to change its position to another location still
farther off and up from the water, a few feet beyond; then the second
is in turn treated in the same way by a third, and so on until
hundreds will be slowly packed together on the shore as thickly as
they can lie—never far back from the surf, however—pillowing
their heads upon the bodies of one another: and, they do not act
at all quarrelsome toward each other. Occasionally, in their lazy,
phlegmatic adjusting and crowding, the posteriors of some old bull
will be lifted up, and remain elevated in the air, while the passive
owner continues to sleep, with its head, perhaps, beneath the pudgy
form of its neighbor.</p>

<p>These pinnipeds are, perhaps, of all animals, the most difficult
subjects that an artist can find to reproduce from life. There are
no angles or elbows to seize hold of. The lines of body and limbs
are all rounded, free and flowing; yet, the very fleshiest examples
never have that bloated, wind-distended look which most of the
published figures give them. One must first become familiarized
with the restless, varying attitudes of these creatures by extended
personal contact and observation ere he can satisfy himself with the
result of his drawings, no matter how expert he may be in rapid and
artistic delineation. Life-studies by artists of the young of the Atlantic
walrus have been made in several instances; but of the mature
animal, until my drawing, there was nothing extant of that character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span></p>

<p>As the walrus came ashore they made no use of their tusks in assistance;
but such effort was all done by their fore flippers and the
“boosting” of exceptionally heavy surf which rolled in at wide intervals,
and for which marine assistance the walrus themselves seemed
to patiently wait. When moving on land they do not seem to have
any real power in the hinder limbs. These are usually pulled and
twitched up behind, or feebly flattened out at right angles to its
body. Terrestrial progression is slowly and tediously made by a
dragging succession of short steps forward on the fore-feet; but if
an alarm is given, it is astonishing to note the contrast which they
present in their method of getting back to sea: they fairly roll and
hustle themselves over and into the waves within an exceedingly
short lapse of time.</p>

<p>When sleeping on drifting ice-floes of the Arctic Ocean, or on
rocks at St. Matthew’s or Walrus Island, they resort to a very singular
method of keeping guard, if I may so term it. In this herd
of three or four hundred male walrus that were beneath my vision,
though nearly all were sleeping, yet the movement of one would
disturb the other, which would raise its head in a stupid manner
for a few moments, grunt once or twice, and before lying down to
sleep again it would strike the slumbering form of its nearest companion
with its tusks, causing that animal to rouse up in turn for
a few moments also, grunt, and pass the blow on to the next, lying
down in the same manner. Thus the word was transferred, as it
were, constantly and unceasingly around, always keeping some one
or two aroused, which consequently were more alert than the rest.</p>

<p>On Walrus Island a particularly large individual walrus was selected
and shot, out of a herd of more than two hundred. This was
done at the author’s instance, who made the following memoranda:
It measured twelve feet seven inches from its bluff nostrils to the
tip of its excessively abbreviated tail, which was not more than two
and one-half or three inches long; it had the surprising girth of
fourteen feet. An immense mass of blubber on the shoulders and
around the neck made the head look strangely small in proportion,
and the posteriors decidedly attenuated; indeed, the whole
weight of the animal was bound up in its girth anteriorly. It was
a physical impossibility for me to weigh this brute, and I therefore
can do nothing but make a guess, having this fact to guide me—that
the head, cut directly off at the junction with the spine, or the
occipital or atlas joint, weighed eighty pounds; that the skin, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
I carefully removed with the aid of these natives, with the head,
weighed five hundred and seventy pounds. Deducting the head
and excluding the flippers, I think it is safe to say that the skin itself
would not weigh less than three hundred and fifty pounds, and
the animal could not weigh much less than a ton, from two thousand
to two thousand two hundred pounds.</p>

<p>The head had a decidedly flattened appearance, for the nostrils,
eyes, and ear-spots seem to be placed nearly on top of the cranium.
The nasal apertures are literally so, opening directly over the muzzle.
They are oval, and closed parallel with the longitudinal axis of
the skull, and when dilated are about an inch in their greatest diameter.</p>

<p>The eyes are small, but prominent; placed nearly on top of the
head, and, protruding from their sockets, they bulge like those of a
lobster. The iris and pupil of this eye is less than one-fourth of its
exposed surface; the sclerotic coat swells out from under the lids
when they are opened, and is of a dirty, mottled coffee-yellow and
brown, with an occasional admixture of white; the iris itself is
light-brown, with dark-brown rays and spots. I noticed that whenever
the animal roused itself, instead of turning its head, it only
rolled its eyes, seldom moving the cranium more than to elevate it.
The eyes seem to move, rotating in every direction when the creature
is startled, giving the face of this monster a very extraordinary
attraction, especially when studied by an artist. The expression
is just indescribable. The range of sight enjoyed by the walrus
out of water, I can testify, is not well developed, for, after throwing
small chips of rock down upon the walruses near me, several
of them not being ten feet distant, and causing them only to stupidly
stare and give vent to low grunts of astonishment, I then rose
gently and silently to my feet, standing boldly up before them;
but then, even, I was not noticed, though their eyes rolled all over
from above to under me. Had I, however, made a little noise, or
had I been standing as far as one thousand yards away from them
to the windward, they would have taken the alarm instantly, and
tumbled off into the sea like so many hustled wool-sacks, for their
sense of smell is of the keen, keenest.</p>

<p>The ears of the walrus, or rather the auricles to the ears, are
on the same lateral line at the top of the head with the nostrils
and eyes, the latter being just midway between. The pavilion, or
auricle, is a mere fleshy wrinkle or fold, not at all raised or developed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>
and from what I could see of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">meatus externus</i> it was very
narrow and small; still, the natives assured me that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Otariidæ</i>
had no better organs of hearing than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosmarus</i>.</p>

<p>The head of the male walrus, to which I have alluded, and from
which I afterward removed the skin, was eighteen inches long between
the nostrils and the post-occipital region; and, although
its enormous tusks seemed to be firmly planted in their osseous
sockets, judge of my astonishment when one of the younger natives
flippantly struck a tusk with a wooden club quite smartly, and then
easily jerked the tooth forth. I had frequently observed that it
was difficult to keep such teeth from rattling out of their alveoli in
any of the best skulls I had gathered of the fur seals and sea-lions,
especially difficult in the case of the latter.</p>

<p>Its tusks, or canines, are set firmly under the nostril-apertures
in deep, massive, bony pockets, giving that strange, broad, square-cut
front of the muzzle so characteristic of its physiognomy.</p>

<p>The upper lips of this walrus of Bering Sea are exceedingly
thick and gristly, and its bluff, square muzzle is studded, in regular
rows and intervals, with a hundred or so, short, stubby, gray-white
bristles, varying in length from one-half to three inches.
There are a few very short and much softer bristles set, also, on
the fairly hidden chin of its lower jaw, which closes up under a
projecting snout and muzzle, and is nearly concealed by the enormous
tushes, when laterally viewed.</p>

<p>The thickness of the skin of the walrus is a marked and most
anomalous feature. I remember well how surprised I was, when I
followed the incision of a broad-axe used in beheading the specimen
shot for my benefit, to find that the skin over its shoulders
and around the throat and chest was three inches thick—a puffy,
spongy epidermis, outwardly hateful to the sight, and inwardly resting
upon a slightly acrid fat or blubber so peculiar to this animal.
Nowhere was that hide, upon the thinnest point of measurement,
less than half an inch thick. It feeds exclusively upon shell-fish
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lamellibranchiata</i>), or clams principally, and also upon the
bulbous roots and tender stalks of certain marine plants and
grasses which grow in great abundance over the bottoms of broad,
shallow lagoons and bays of the main Alaskan coast. I took from
the paunch of the walrus above mentioned more than a bushel of
crushed clams in their shells, all of which that animal had evidently
just swallowed, for digestion had scarcely commenced. Many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
those clams in that stomach, large as my clinched hands, were not
even broken; and it is in digging this shell-fish food that the services
rendered by its enormous tusks become apparent.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>I am not in accord with some singular tales told, on the Atlantic
side, about the uses of these gleaming ivory teeth, so famous
and conspicuous: I believe that the Alaskan walrus employs them
solely in his labor of digging clams and rooting bulbs from those
muddy oozes and sand-bars in the estuary waters peculiar to his
geographical distribution. Certainly, it is difficult for me to reconcile
my idea of such uncouth, timid brutes, as were those spread
before me on Walrus Islet, with any of the strange chapters written
as to the ferocity and devilish courage of a Greenland “morse.”
These animals were exceedingly cowardly, abjectly so. It is with
the greatest difficulty that the natives, when a herd of walruses are
surprised, can get a second shot at them. So far from clustering
in attack around their boats, it is the very reverse, and a hunter’s
only solicitude is which way to travel in order that he may come
up with the fleeing animals as they rise to breathe.</p>

<p>On questioning the natives, as we returned, they told me that
the walrus of Bering Sea was monogamous, and that the difference
between the sexes in size, color, and shape is inconsiderable; or, in
other words, that until the males are old the young males and the
females of all ages are not remarkably distinct, and would not be at
all if it were not for their teeth. They said that the female brings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
forth her young, a single calf, in June usually, on the ice-floes in
the Arctic Ocean, above Bering Straits, between Point Barrow and
Cape Seartze Kammin; that this calf resembles the parent in general
proportions and color when it is hardly over six weeks old, but
that the tusks (which give it its most distinguishing expression) are
not visible until the second year of its life; that the walrus mother
is strongly attached to her offspring, and nurses it later through
the season in the sea; that the walrus sleeps profoundly in the
water, floating almost vertically, with barely more than the nostrils
above water, and can be easily approached, if care is taken as to the
wind, so as to spear it or thrust a lance into its bowels; that the
bulls do not fight as savagely as the fur-seal or the sea-lion; that
the blunted tusks of these combatants seldom do more than bruise
their thick hides; that they can remain under water nearly an hour,
or about twice as long as the seals, and that they sink like so many
stones immediately after being shot at sea.</p>

<p>I personally made no experiments touching the peculiarity of
sinking immediately after being shot. Of course, on reflection, it
will appear to any mind that all seals, no matter how fat or how lean,
would sink instantly out of sight, if not killed, at the shock of a
bullet; even if mortally wounded, the great involuntary impulse
of brain and muscle would be to dive and speed away, for all swimming
is submarine when pinnipeds desire to travel.</p>

<p>Touching this mooted question, I had an opportunity when in
Port Townsend, during 1874, to ask a man who had served as a
partner in a fur-sealing schooner off the Straits of Fuca. He told
me that unless a seal was instantly killed by the passage of his
rifle-bullet through its brain, it was never secured, and would sink
before they could reach the bubbling wake of its disappearance.
If, however, the aim of a marksman had been correct, then its body
was invariably taken within five to ten minutes after the rifle discharge.
Only one man does the shooting; the rest of such a
crew, ten to twelve white men and Indians, man canoes and boats
which are promptly despatched from the schooner, after each report,
in the direction of a victim. How long one of the bodies
of these “clean” killed seals would float he did not know; the
practice always was to get it as quickly as possible, fearing that
the bearings of its position, when shot from a schooner, might be
confused or lost. He also affirmed that, in his opinion, there were
not a dozen men on the whole northwest coast who were good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
enough with a rifle, and expert at distance calculation, to shoot fur-seals
successfully from the deck of a vessel on the ocean. The
Indians of Cape Flattery do most of their pelagic fur-sealing by
cautiously approaching from the leeward when these animals are
asleep, and then throw line-darts or harpoons into them before they
awaken.</p>

<p>The finest bidarrah skin-boats of transportation that I have seen
in this country were those of the St. Lawrence natives. These were
made out of dressed walrus-hides, shaved and pared down by them
to the requisite thickness, so that when they were sewed with
sinews to the wooden whalebone-lashed frames of such boats they
dried into a pale greenish-white prior to oiling, and were even then
almost translucent, tough and strong.</p>

<p>When I stepped, for the first time, into the baidar of St. Paul
Island, and went ashore, from the <em>Alexander</em>, over a heavy sea,
safely to the lower bight of Lukannon Bay, my sensations were of
emphatic distrust; the partially water-softened skin-covering would
puff up between the wooden ribs, and then draw back, as the waves
rose and fell, so much like an unstable support above the cold, green
water below, that I frankly expressed my surprise at such an
outlandish craft. My thoughts quickly turned to a higher appreciation
of those hardy navigators who used these vessels in circumpolar
seas years ago, and of the Russians who, more recently,
employed bidarrahs chiefly to explore Alaskan and Kamchatkan
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terræ incognita</i>. There is an old poem in Avitus, written by a
Roman as early as 445 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; it describes the ravages of Saxon
pirates along the southern coasts of Britain, who used just such
vessels as this bidarrah of St Paul.</p>

<p>These boats were probably covered with either horse’s or bulls’
hides. When used in England they were known as <em>coracles</em>; in
Ireland they were styled <em>curachs</em>. Pliny tells us that Cæsar moved
his army in Britain over lakes and rivers in such boats. Even the
Greeks used them, terming them <em>karabia</em>; and the Russian word
of <em>korabl</em>’, or “ship,” is derived from it. King Alfred, in 870-872,
tells us that the Finns made sad havoc among many Swedish settlements
on the numerous “meres” (lakes) in the moors of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span>
country, by “carrying their ships (baidars) overland to the meres
whence they make depredations on the Northmen; their ships are
small and very light.”</p>

<p>Until I saw these bidarrahs of the St. Lawrence natives, in 1874,
I was more or less inclined to believe that the tough, thick, and
spongy hide of a walrus would be too refractory in dressing for
use in covering such light frames, especially those of the bidarka;
but the manifest excellence and seaworthiness of those Eskimo
boats satisfied me that I was mistaken. I saw, however, abundant
evidence of a much greater labor required to tan or pare down
this thick cuticle to that thin, dense transparency so marked on
their bidarrahs; for the pelt of a hair-seal, or sea-lion, does not
need any more attention, when applied to this service, than that of
simply unhairing it. This is done by first sweating the “loughtak”
in piles, then rudely, but rapidly, scraping with blunt knives or
stone flensers the hair off in large patches at every stroke; the
skin is then air-dried, being stretched on a stout frame, where, in
the lapse of a few weeks, it becomes as rigid as a board. Whenever
wanted for use thereafter, it is soaked in water until soft or
“green” again; then it is sewed with sinews, while in this fresh
condition, tightly over the slight wooden skeleton of the bidarka or
the heavier frame of a bidarrah. In this manner all boats and
lighters at the islands are covered. Then they are air-dried thoroughly
before oiling, which is done when the skin has become well
indurated, so as to bind the ribs and keel as with an iron plating.
The thick, unrefined seal-oil keeps the water out for twelve to
twenty hours, according to the character of the hides. When,
however, the skin-covering begins to “bag in” between the ribs of
its frame, then it is necessary to haul the bidarrah out and air-dry
it again, and then re-oil. If attended to thoroughly and constantly,
those skin-covered boats are the best species of lighter which
can be used in these waters, for they will stand more thumping and
pounding on the rocks and alongside ship than all wooden, or even
corrugated-iron, lighters could endure and remain seaworthy.</p>

<p>The flesh of the walrus is not, to our palate, at all toothsome;
it is positively uninviting. That flavor of the raw, rank mollusca,
upon which it feeds, seems to permeate every fibre of its flesh, making
it very offensive to the civilized palate; but the Eskimo, who
do not have any of our squeamishness, regard it as highly and feed
upon it as steadily, as we do on our own best corn-fed beef. Indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>
the walrus to an Eskimo answers just as the cocoa-palm does to
a South Sea islander: it feeds him, it clothes him, it heats and
illuminates his “igloo,” and it arms him for the chase, while he
builds a summer shelter and rides upon the sea by virtue of its hide.
The morse, however, is not of much account to the seal-hunters
on the Pribylov Islands. They still find, by stirring up the sand-dunes
and digging about them at Northeast Point, all the ivory that
they require for their domestic use on the islands, nothing else belonging
to a walrus being of the slightest economic value to them.
Some authorities have spoken well of walrus-meat as an article of
diet. Either they had that sauce for it born of inordinate hunger,
or else the cooks deceived them. Starving explorers in the arctic
regions could relish it—<em>they</em> would thankfully and gladly eat anything
that was juicy, and sustained life, with zest and gastronomic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
fervor. The Eskimo naturally like it; it is a necessity to their
existence, and thus a relish for it is acquired. I can readily understand,
by personal experience, how a great many, perhaps a majority
of our own people, could speak well, were they north, of seal-meat,
of whale “rind,” and of polar-bear steaks; but I know that a mouthful
of fresh or “cured” walrus-flesh would make their “gorges rise.”
The St. Paul natives refuse to touch it as an article of diet in any
shape or manner. I saw them removing the enormous testicles of
an old morse which was shot, for my purposes, on Walrus Island.
They told me they did so in obedience to the wishes of a widow
doctress at the village, Maria Seedova, who desired a pair for her
incantations.</p>

<p>Curiosity, mingled with a desire to really understand, alone
tempted me to taste some walrus-meat which was placed before
me at Poonook, on St. Lawrence Island; and candor compels me
to say that it was worse than the old beaver’s tail which I had been
victimized with in British Columbia, worse than the tough brown-bear
steak of Bristol Bay—in fact, it is the worst of all fresh flesh
of which I know. It had a strong flavor of an indefinite acrid
nature, which turned my palate and my stomach instantaneously
and simultaneously, while the surprised natives stared in bewildered
silence at their astonished and disgusted guest. They, however,
greedily put chunks, two inches square and even larger, of this
flesh and blubber into their mouths as rapidly as the storage room
there would permit; and with what grimy gusto! as the corners
of their large lips dripped with the fatness of their feeding. How
little they thought, then, that in a few short seasons they would die
of starvation, sitting in these same igloos—their caches empty and
nothing but endless fields of barren ice where a life-giving sea
should be. The winter of 1879-80 was one of exceptional rigor in
the Arctic, although in the United States it was unusually mild and
open. The ice closed in solid around St. Lawrence Island—so firm
and unshaken by the giant leverage of wind and tide that all walrus
were driven far to the southward and eastward beyond the reach
of those unhappy inhabitants of that island, who, thus unexpectedly
deprived of their mainstay and support, seemed to have miserably
starved to death then, with an exception of one small village
on the north shore: thus, the residents of Poonook, Poogovellyak,
and Kagallegak settlements perished, to a soul, from hunger;
nearly three hundred men, women, and children. I recall that visit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>
which I made to these alert Innuits, August, 1874, with sadness, in
this unfortunate connection, because they impressed me with their
manifest superiority over the savages of our northwest coast. They
seemed, then, to be living, during nine months of the year, almost
wholly upon the flesh and oil of the morse. Clean-limbed, bright-eyed,
and jovial, they profoundly impressed me with their happy
reliance and subsistence upon the walrus-herds of Bering Sea. I
could not help remarking then, that these people had never been
subjected to the temptations and subsequent sorrow of putting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
their trust in princes; hence their independence and good heart.
But now it appears that it will not do to put your trust in <em>Rosmarus</em>
either.</p>

<p>I know that it is said by Parry, by Hall, and lately by others,
that the flesh of the Atlantic walrus is palatable; perhaps the nature
of its food-supply is the cause. We all recognize a wide difference
in pork from hogs fed on corn and those fed on beech-mast
and oak-acorns, and those which have lived upon the offal of the
slaughtering houses, or have gathered the decayed castings of the
sea-shore; the sea-horse of Bering Sea lives upon that which does
not give a pleasant flavor to its flesh.</p>

<p>The range of our Alaskan walrus now appears to be restricted
in the Arctic Ocean to an extreme westward at Cape Chelagskoi, on
the Siberian coast, and an extreme eastward between Point Barrow
and the region of Point Beechey, on the Alaskan shore. It is, however,
substantially confined between Koliutchin Bay, Siberia, and
Point Barrow, Alaska. As far as its distribution in polar waters is
concerned, and how far to the north it travels from these coasts of
two continents, I am unable to present any well-authenticated data
illustrative of the subject; the shores of Wrangel Island were found
in possession of walrus-herds during the season of 1881.</p>

<p>This walrus has, however, a very wide range of distribution in
Alaska, though not near so great as in prehistoric times. They
abound to the eastward and southeastward of St. Paul, over in
Bristol Bay, where great numbers congregate on the sand-bars and
flats, now flooded, now bared by the rising and ebbing of the tide;
they are hunted here to a considerable extent for their ivory. No
morse are found south of the Aleutian Islands; still, not more than
forty-five or fifty years ago, small gatherings of these animals were
killed here and there on some islands between Kadiak and Oonimak
Pass; the greatest aggregate of them, south of Bering Straits, will
always be found in the estuaries of Bristol Bay and on the north
side of the peninsula of Alaska.</p>

<p>I have been frequently questioned whether, in my opinion, more
than a short space of time would elapse ere the walrus was exterminated,
or not, since our whalers had begun to hunt them in Bering
Sea and the Arctic Ocean. To this I frankly make answer that I
do not know enough of the subject to give a correct judgment. The
walrus spend most of their time in waters that are within reach of
these skilful and hardy navigators; and if they (the walrus) are of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
sufficient value to a whaler, he can and undoubtedly will make a
business of killing them, and work the same sad result that he has
brought about with the mighty schools of cetacea which once
whistled and bared their backs, throughout the now deserted waters
of Bering Sea, in perfect peace and seclusion prior to 1842. The
returns of the old Russian America Company show that an annual
average of ten thousand walrus have been slain by the Eskimo since
1799 to 1867. There are a great many left yet; but, unless the oil
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosmarus</i> becomes very precious commercially, I think the shoal
waters of Bristol Bay and Kuskokvim mouth, together with the eccentric
tides thereof, will preserve the species indefinitely. Forty
years ago, when the North Pacific was a rendezvous of the greatest
whaling-fleet that ever floated, those vessels could not, nor can they
now, approach nearer than sixty or even eighty miles of many
muddy shoals, sands, and bars upon which the walrus rest in Bristol
Bay, scattered in herds of a dozen or so to bodies of thousands,
living in lethargic peace and almost unmolested, except in several
small districts which are carefully hunted over by the natives of
Oogashik for oil and ivory. I have been credibly informed that
they also breed in Bristol Bay, and along its coast as far north as
Cape Avinova, during seasons of exceptional rigor in the Arctic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span></p>

<p>The Innuits of St. Lawrence, and all of their race living above
them, hunt the walrus without any excitement other than that of
securing such quarry. They never speak of real danger. When
they do not shoot them as these beasts drift in sleepy herds on ice-floes,
then they surprise them on the beaches or reefs and destroy
a herd by spearing and lancing. When harpooned or speared, a
head of the weapon is so made as to detach itself from its shank,
and by thus sticking in the carcass a line of walrus-hide is made fast
to the plethoric body of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosmarus</i>. When this brute has expended
its surplus vitality by towing the natives a few miles in a mad, frenzied
burst of swimming, their bidarrah is quietly drawn up to its
puffing form close enough to permit of a <em>coup</em> by an ivory-headed
lance; it is then towed to a beach at high water. When the ebb is
well out, the huge carcass is skinned by its dusky butchers, who
out it up into large square chunks of flesh and blubber, which are
deposited in queer little “Dutch-oven” caches of each family that
are made especially for its reception.</p>

<p>Dressing walrus-hides is the only serious hard labor which
the Alaskan Innuit subjects himself to. He cannot lay it entirely
upon the women, as the Sioux do when they spread buffalo bodies
all over the plains. It is too much for female strength alone, and
so the men bear a hand right lustily in this business. It takes from
four to six stout natives, when a green walrus-hide is removed, to
carry it to a sweating-hole, where it is speedily unhaired. Then,
stretched alternately upon air-frames and pinned over the earth, it
is gradually scraped down to a requisite thinness for use in covering
the bidarrah skeletons, etc.</p>

<p>There are probably six or seven thousand human beings in
Alaska who live largely by virtue of the existence of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosmarus</i>, and
every year, when the season opens, they gather together by settlements,
as they are contiguous, and discuss the walrus chances for
a coming year as earnestly and as wisely as our farmers who confer
over their prospects for corn and potatoes. But an Eskimo
hunter is a sadly improvident mortal, though he is not wasteful of
morse life, while we are provident, and yet wasteful of our resources.</p>

<p>If the North Pole is ever reached by our people, they will do so
only when they can eat walrus-meat and get plenty of it—at least
that is my belief—and, knowing now what the diet is, I think the
journey to that hyperborean <em>ultima</em> is a long one, though there is
plenty of meat and many men who want to try it.</p>

<p>Unless we spend a winter in the Arctic Ocean above Bering
Straits we will not be able to see a polar bear; but there is one place,
and one place only, in Alaska where in midsummer we can land,
and there behold on its swelling, green, and flowery uplands hundreds
of these huge ursine brutes. That place is the island of St.
Matthew, and it is right in our path as we leave St. Lawrence and
head for Oonimak Pass and home.</p>

</figure>

<p>St. Matthew Island is an odd, jagged, straggling reach of bluffs
and headlands, connected by bars and lowland spits. The former,
seen at a little distance out at sea, resemble half a dozen distinct islands.
The extreme length is twenty-two miles, and it is exceedingly
narrow in proportion. Hall Island is a small one that lies west from
it, separated from it by a strait (Sarichev) less than three miles in
width, while the only other outlying land is a sharp, jagged pinnacle-rock,
rearing itself over a thousand feet abruptly from the sea,
standing five miles south of Sugar-loaf Cone on the main island.
From a cleft and blackened fissure, near the summit of this serrated
pinnacle-rock, volcanic fire and puffs of black smoke have been
recorded as issuing when first discovered, and they have issued ever
since.</p>

<p>Our first landing, early in the morning of August 5th, was at the
spot under Cub Hill, near Cape Upright, the easternmost point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span>
the island. The air came out from the northwest cold and chilly,
and snow and ice were on the hill-sides and in the gullies. The
sloping sides and summits of these hills were of a grayish, russet
tinge, with deep-green swale flats running down into the lowlands,
which are there more intensely green and warmer in tone. A
pebble-bar formed by the sea between Cape Upright and Waterfall
Head is covered with a deep stratum of glacial drift, carried down
from the flanks of Polar and Cub Hills, and extending over two
miles of this water-front to the westward, where it is met by a similar
washing from that quarter. Back, and in the centre of this
neck, are several small lakes and lagoons without fish; but emptying
into them are a number of clear, lively brooks, in which were
salmon-parr of fine quality. The little lakes undoubtedly receive
them; hence they were land-locked salmon. A luxuriant growth
of thick moss and grass, interspersed, existed almost everywhere on
the lowest ground; and occasionally strange dome-like piles of peat
were lifted four or five feet above marshy swales, and appeared so
remarkably like abandoned barraboras that we repeatedly turned
from our course to satisfy ourselves personally to the contrary.</p>

<p>As these lowlands ascend to the tops of higher hills, all vegetation
changes rapidly to a simple coat of cryptogamic gray and light
russet, with a slippery slide for the foot wherever a steep flight or
climbing was made. Water oozes and trickles everywhere under
foot, since an exhalation of frost is in progress all the time. Sometimes
these swales rise and cross hill-summits to the valleys again
without any interruption in their wet, swampy character. The action
of ice in rounding down and grinding hills, chipping bluffs,
and chiselling everywhere, carrying the soil and <em>débris</em> into depressions
and valleys, is most beautifully exhibited on St. Matthew.
The hills at the foot of Sugar-loaf Cone are bare and literally
polished by ice-sheets and slides of melting snow. Rocks
and soil from these summits and slopes are carried down and
“dumped,” as it were, in numberless little heaps beneath, so that
the foot of every hill and out on the plain around strongly put
us in mind of those refuse-piles which are dropped over the commons
or dumping-grounds of a city. Nowhere can the work of ice
be seen to finer advantage than here, aided and abetted, as it undoubtedly
is, by the power of wind, especially with regard to that
chiselling action of frost on the faces of ringing metallic porphyry
cliffs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span></p>

<p>The flora here is as extensive as on the Seal Islands, two hundred
miles to the southward; but the species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gramma</i> are not
near so varied. Indeed, there is very little grass around about.
Wherever there is soil it seems to be converted by the abundant
moisture into a swale or swamp, over which we travelled as on a
quaking water-bed; but on the rounded hilltops and ridge-summits
wind-driven and frost-splintered shingle makes good walking.
Both of these climatic agencies evidently have a permanent iron
grip on this island.</p>

<p>The west end of St. Matthew differs materially from the east.
A fantastic weathering of the rocks at Cathedral Point, Hall Island,
will strike the eye of a most casual observer as his ship enters
the straits going south. This eastern wall of that point looms up
from the water like a row of immense cedar-tree trunks. The
scaling off of basaltic porphyry and a growth of yellowish-green
and red mossy lichens made the effect most real, while a vast bank
of fog lying just overhead seemed to shut out from our vision the
foliage and branches that should be above. This north cape of
Hall Island changes when approached, with every mile’s distance,
to a new and altogether different profile.</p>

<p>Our visit at the west end of the island of St. Matthew was, geologically
speaking, the most interesting experience I have ever
had in Alaska. A geologist who may desire to study the greatest
variety of igneous forms <em>in situ</em>, within a short and easy radius,
can do no better than make his survey here. These rocks are not
only varied by mineral colors, together with a fantastic arrangement
of basalt and porphyry, but are rich and elegant in their tinting
by the profuse growth of lichens—brown, yellow, green, and
bronze.</p>

<p>An old Russian record prepared us, in landing, to find bears
here, but it did not cause us to be equal to the sight we saw, for
we met bears—yea, hundreds of them. I was going to say that I
saw bears here as I had seen seals to the south, but that, of course,
will not do, unless as a mere figure of speech. During the nine
days that we were busy in surveying this island, we never were
one moment, while on land, out of sight of a bear or bears; their
white forms in the distance always answered to our search, though
they ran from our immediate presence with a wild celerity, travelling
in a swift, shambling gallop, or trotting off like elephants.
Whether due to the fact that they were gorged with food, or that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span>
the warmer weather of summer subdued their temper, we never
could coax one of these animals to show fight. Its first impulse
and its last one, while within our influence, was flight—males, females,
and cubs—all, when surprised by us, rushing with one accord
right, left, and in every direction, over the hills and far away.</p>

<p>After shooting half a dozen, we destroyed no more, for we
speedily found that we had made their acquaintance at the height
of their shedding-season, and their snowy and highly prized winter-dress
was a very different article from the dingy, saffron-colored,
grayish fur that was flying like downy feathers in the wind, when
ever rubbed or pulled by our hands. They never growled, or uttered
any sound whatever, even when shot or wounded.</p>

<p>Here, on the highest points, where no moss ever grows, and
nothing but a fine porphyritic shingle slides and rattles beneath our
tread, are bear-roads leading from nest to nest, or stony lairs, which
they have scooped out of frost-splintered <em>débris</em> on the hill-sides,
and where old she-bears undoubtedly bring forth their young: but
it was not plain, because we saw them only sleeping, at this season
of the year, on the lower ground; they seemed to delight in stretching
themselves upon, and rolling over, the rankest vegetation.</p>

<p>They sleep soundly, but fitfully, rolling their heavy arms and
legs about as they doze. For naps they seem to prefer little grassy
depressions on the sunny hill-sides and along the numerous water-courses,
and their paths were broad and well beaten all over the
island. We could not have observed less than two hundred and
fifty or three hundred of these animals while we were there; at
one landing on Hall Island there were sixteen in full sight at one
sweep of our eyes, scampering up and off from the approach of the
ship’s boat.</p>

<p>Provided with more walrus-meat than he knows what to do with,
the polar bear, in my opinion, has never cared much for the Seal
Islands; the natives have seen them, however, on St. Paul, and its
old men have their bear stories, which they tell to a rising generation.
The last “medvait” killed on St. Paul Island was shot at
Bogaslov in 1848; none have ever come down since, and very
few were there before, but those few evidently originated at and
made St. Matthew Island their point of departure. Hence I desire
to notice this hitherto unexplored spot, standing, as it does, two
hundred miles to the northward of St. Paul, and which, until
Lieutenant Maynard and myself, in 1874, surveyed and walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span>
over its entire coast-line, had not been trodden by white men, or by
natives, since that dismal record made by a party of five Russians
and seven Aleutes who passed the winter of 1810-11 on it, and
who were so stricken down with scurvy as to cause the death of all
the Russians save one, while the rest barely recovered and left
early the following year. We found the ruins of those huts which
had been occupied by this unfortunate and discomfited party of
fur-hunters; they were landed there to secure polar bears in the
depth of winter, when such shaggy coats should be the finest.</p>

<p>As we complete our review of St. Matthew and its ursine occupation,
the circuit of Alaska has been made—its impression we have
recorded, and the path from here home again is a bee-line to the
Golden Gate over</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_164" href="#FNanchor_164" class="label">[164]</a> These favored basaltic tables are also commented upon in similar connection
by an old writer in 1775, Shuldham, who calls them “echouries;” he is
describing the Atlantic walrus as it appears at the Magdalen Islands: “The
echouries are formed principally by nature, being a gradual slope of soft rock,
with which the Magdalen Islands abound, about eighty to one hundred yards
wide at the water-side, and spreading so as to contain, near the summit, a very
considerable number.” The tables at Walrus Island and those at Southwest
Point are very much less in area than those described by Shuldham, and are
a small series of low, saw-tooth jetties of the harder basalt, washed in relief,
from a tufa matrix; there is no room to the landward of them for many walruses
to lie upon. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Odobœnus</i> does not like to haul up on loose or shingly
shores, because it has the greatest difficulty in getting a solid hold for its fore
flippers with which to pry up and move ahead its huge, clumsy body. When it
hauls on a sand-beach, it never attempts to crawl out to the dry region back of
the surf, but lies just awash, at high water. In this fashion they used to rest
all along the sand-reaches of St. Paul prior to the Russian advent in 1786-87;
and when Shuldham was inditing his letters on the habits of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rosmarus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Odobœnus</i>

<p><a id="Footnote_165" href="#FNanchor_165" class="label">[165]</a> It is, and always will be, a source of sincere regret to me and my friends
that I did not bodily preserve this huge paunch and its contents. It would
have filled a half-barrel very snugly, and then its mass of freshly swallowed
clams (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mya truncata</i>), filmy streaks of macerated kelp, and fragments of crustaceans,
could have been carefully examined during a week of leisure at the
Smithsonian Institution. It was, however, ripped open so quickly by one of the
Aleutes, who kicked the contents out, that I hardly knew what had been done
ere the strong-smelling subject was directly under my nose. The natives then
were anxious that I should hurry through with my sketches, measurements,
etc., so that they might the sooner push off their egg-laden bidarrah and cross
back to the main island before the fogs would settle over our homeward track,
or the rapidly rising wind shift to the northward and imperil our passage.
Weighty reasons these, which so fully impressed me, that this unique stomach
of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carnivora</i> was overlooked and left behind; hence, with the exception of
curiously turning over the clams (especially those uncrushed specimens), which
formed the great bulk of its contents, I have no memoranda or even distinct
recollection of the other materials that were incorporated.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
